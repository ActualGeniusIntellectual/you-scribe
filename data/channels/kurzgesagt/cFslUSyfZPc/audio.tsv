0	5000	Black holes can destroy everything. But can they be destroyed?
5000	11000	What happens if we push physics to the absolute limit, maybe even breaking it and the universe in the process?
11000	18000	Let's create a tiny black hole about the mass of our moon in the Kurzgesagt labs and try to rip it apart.
18000	21000	Experiment 1. Nuke it.
21000	29000	Big booms break things, so to set the mood, let's explode the world's entire nuclear arsenal around our black hole.
29000	35000	Boom. Black holes swallow whatever crosses their event horizon, matter and energy.
35000	40000	And since E equals mc2, all the energy that enters a black hole increases its mass.
40000	48000	The mass of a black hole is proportional to its size, so as we nuke our tiny black hole, it just gets bigger and more massive.
48000	51000	Experiment 2. Antimatter.
51000	58000	Matter and antimatter annihilate each other. What will happen if we throw a moon's mass of antimatter at it?
58000	66000	Unfortunately, when an object enters a black hole, the black hole will completely delete its past identity, whether it's made of matter or of antimatter.
66000	71000	Black holes only care about gravity, which only depends on the total mass energy of an object.
71000	79000	And the mass of a particle is the same as its corresponding antiparticle, so throwing an antimoon has the same effect as throwing a moon.
79000	81000	The black hole just gets more massive.
81000	85000	This deleting ability of black holes is pretty interesting.
85000	91000	It means that despite their size and power, black holes are, in a way, similar to elementary particles.
91000	100000	An elementary particle like an electron is an extremely simple object, fully specified by just three numbers, its mass, spin and charge.
100000	107000	And, amazingly, the same is true for black holes. They have a mass, they can rotate and carry an electric charge.
107000	117000	Once a black hole forms, it doesn't matter if it comes from a collapsed star, an anti-star or a banana, it will always be fully described by those three numbers, nothing else.
117000	124000	But if a black hole is basically a weird particle, could we destroy it with an anti-black hole?
124000	128000	Experiment 3. Anti-black hole.
128000	134000	How exciting! A particle has the same mass as its corresponding antiparticle, but opposite charge.
135000	142000	Since a black hole has mass and electric charge, its corresponding anti-black hole should have the same mass and opposite electric charge.
142000	144000	What if we make them collide?
144000	147000	Sadly, the charge will just add up and cancel out.
147000	153000	So, after the collision, we'll just get a new black hole twice as massive with no charge.
153000	157000	Okay, we need to think bigger and stretch physics harder.
159000	163000	Experiment 4. Destroy the event horizon.
163000	169000	It's true that a black hole can carry spin and charge, but even for these crazy objects, there are limits.
169000	176000	If the spin or the charge of a black hole becomes too large, something really weird will happen. The event horizon will dissolve.
176000	188000	In a simplified way, we think of black holes as hiding a singularity inside, an infinitely compressed mass with such strong gravity that absolutely nothing can escape from its surroundings, not even light.
188000	192000	This is why a black hole looks like a black sphere of nothingness.
192000	198000	The event horizon is the outer edge of this ultimate prism. Cross it, and you'll never be able to come back.
198000	202000	But when a black hole rotates, it works a bit like a spinning washing machine.
202000	210000	It's as if the rotation wants to repel nearby objects and push them out of the black hole, which doesn't happen because its gravity is so strong.
210000	216000	But, if the rotation gets too fast, this effect will win and the event horizon will disappear.
216000	219000	Nearby objects won't be imprisoned forever anymore.
219000	225000	The same thing happens with the electric charge. Make it too large, and our ironclad jail will break open.
225000	233000	If we manage to destroy the event horizon, the singularity would still be there, and objects would still naturally fall towards it.
233000	237000	If you hit it, you would still die horribly and quickly.
237000	244000	But the vicinity of the singularity won't be an inescapable prison anymore. You could get as close as you want and come back.
245000	249000	This should count as destroying the black hole. Can we do it?
253000	257000	All we have to do is to overcharge or overspin the black hole.
257000	265000	We could do this by throwing objects with a small mass and a lot of charge or angular momentum so that the charge or spin increases faster than the mass.
265000	269000	We have to overfeed the black hole until it reaches the point where it breaks open.
269000	274000	However, whether you can actually do this is the subject of passionate argument among physicists.
274000	276000	Think of a charged black hole.
276000	281000	Equal charges repel each other, and the more of the same charges you squish together, the more they push back.
281000	289000	So let's say that we have a negatively charged black hole and we want to overfeed it with electrons, for example, whose charge is far larger than its mass.
289000	298000	The electrons will feel an electrostatic repulsion, and the more electrons we throw, the larger the negative charge of the black hole will be and the stronger the repulsion.
298000	305000	But once we reach the upper limit, the electrostatic repulsion will be so strong that it won't allow any more electrons to come in.
305000	308000	At this point, the black hole will refuse to be overfed.
308000	314000	With the spin, it's similar. Once the black hole reaches its upper limit, it won't gobble more spin.
314000	317000	But some scientists have discovered what looks like a loophole.
317000	326000	If an instant before the black hole reaches the limit, we throw the right amount of matter in in just the right way, it looks like we could actually overfeed it.
326000	330000	Most scientists are skeptical, but let's give it a try anyway.
330000	334000	The end. Breaking physics.
334000	339000	There is a catch, though. The event horizon of a black hole hides the singularity.
339000	346000	So destroying the horizon would leave us with a naked singularity, one that is not hidden by an event horizon.
346000	350000	And this poses a problem. It could mean the end of physics as we know it.
350000	358000	There's a big dirty secret about black holes. Contrary to widespread belief, the singularity of a black hole is not really at its center.
358000	362000	No. It's in the future of whatever crosses the horizon.
362000	369000	Black holes warp the universe so drastically that at the event horizon, space and time switch their roles.
369000	374000	Once you cross it, falling towards the center means going towards the future.
374000	376000	That's why you can't escape.
376000	382000	Stopping your fall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past.
382000	387000	So the singularity is actually in your future, not in front of you.
387000	392000	And just like you can't see your own future, you won't see the singularity until you hit it.
392000	400000	But you also can't hit something that's in your future, only sort of experience it, like you'll experience your next birthday when it happens.
400000	405000	Singularities that are in the future are not a problem because we can't see them or interact with them.
405000	411000	But a naked singularity would be in front of us for all of us to see. What would we see?
411000	414000	Well, the whole point is that it's impossible to know.
414000	419000	A singularity is a region of infinite gravity and gravity is the bending of space-time.
419000	425000	At a singularity, the bending is so radical that the fabric of space-time is literally broken.
425000	428000	Space and time don't exist anymore.
428000	436000	This means that you can't predict anything since predicting means making a forecast about where and when something will happen.
436000	439000	But where and when have lost their meaning.
439000	444000	So we have an unpredictable thing with infinite gravity and therefore infinite energy.
444000	450000	This means that anything could come out of it for no reason, from a pile of bananas to lost socks or a solar system.
450000	455000	Predictability, causality, and physics as we know it would break down.
455000	464000	We think that singularities should exist in nature because we can prove that under very general conditions, gravitational collapse leads to the formation of singularities.
464000	469000	However, scientists think that nature forbids the formation of naked singularities.
469000	476000	Something enforces the creation of an event horizon around them to prevent their insanity from infecting the rest of the universe.
476000	480000	Without event horizons, physics may not make sense at all.
480000	489000	So although black holes have been portrayed as the ultimate monsters of the universe, they may actually be the heroes that keep us safe from the madness of singularities.
489000	494000	So if we do destroy the horizon, we might destroy the fundamental rules of the universe.
494000	497000	You know what? Let's not do that.
501000	505000	As far as we know, there's just one safe method to destroy a black hole.
506000	511000	All black holes emit tiny particles, a phenomenon called Hawking radiation.
511000	519000	This process causes them to slowly lose mass until they eventually evaporate, leaving behind no horizon and no naked singularity.
519000	524000	The time it takes for a black hole to completely evaporate depends on its mass.
524000	530000	For our mini black hole, the size of a speck of dust, it will be about 10 to the power of 44 years.
530000	535000	10 billion, trillion, trillion times the present age of the universe.
535000	538000	So is it possible to destroy a black hole?
538000	540000	Yes, we just have to wait.
541000	543000	But you don't have to wait that long.
