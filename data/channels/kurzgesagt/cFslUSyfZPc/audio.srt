1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Black holes can destroy everything. But can they be destroyed?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What happens if we push physics to the absolute limit, maybe even breaking it and the universe in the process?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's create a tiny black hole about the mass of our moon in the Kurzgesagt labs and try to rip it apart.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Experiment 1. Nuke it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Big booms break things, so to set the mood, let's explode the world's entire nuclear arsenal around our black hole.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Boom. Black holes swallow whatever crosses their event horizon, matter and energy.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And since E equals mc2, all the energy that enters a black hole increases its mass.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The mass of a black hole is proportional to its size, so as we nuke our tiny black hole, it just gets bigger and more massive.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Experiment 2. Antimatter.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Matter and antimatter annihilate each other. What will happen if we throw a moon's mass of antimatter at it?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Unfortunately, when an object enters a black hole, the black hole will completely delete its past identity, whether it's made of matter or of antimatter.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Black holes only care about gravity, which only depends on the total mass energy of an object.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And the mass of a particle is the same as its corresponding antiparticle, so throwing an antimoon has the same effect as throwing a moon.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The black hole just gets more massive.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This deleting ability of black holes is pretty interesting.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It means that despite their size and power, black holes are, in a way, similar to elementary particles.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
An elementary particle like an electron is an extremely simple object, fully specified by just three numbers, its mass, spin and charge.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And, amazingly, the same is true for black holes. They have a mass, they can rotate and carry an electric charge.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Once a black hole forms, it doesn't matter if it comes from a collapsed star, an anti-star or a banana, it will always be fully described by those three numbers, nothing else.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But if a black hole is basically a weird particle, could we destroy it with an anti-black hole?

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Experiment 3. Anti-black hole.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How exciting! A particle has the same mass as its corresponding antiparticle, but opposite charge.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Since a black hole has mass and electric charge, its corresponding anti-black hole should have the same mass and opposite electric charge.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What if we make them collide?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sadly, the charge will just add up and cancel out.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, after the collision, we'll just get a new black hole twice as massive with no charge.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, we need to think bigger and stretch physics harder.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Experiment 4. Destroy the event horizon.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's true that a black hole can carry spin and charge, but even for these crazy objects, there are limits.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If the spin or the charge of a black hole becomes too large, something really weird will happen. The event horizon will dissolve.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In a simplified way, we think of black holes as hiding a singularity inside, an infinitely compressed mass with such strong gravity that absolutely nothing can escape from its surroundings, not even light.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is why a black hole looks like a black sphere of nothingness.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The event horizon is the outer edge of this ultimate prism. Cross it, and you'll never be able to come back.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But when a black hole rotates, it works a bit like a spinning washing machine.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's as if the rotation wants to repel nearby objects and push them out of the black hole, which doesn't happen because its gravity is so strong.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But, if the rotation gets too fast, this effect will win and the event horizon will disappear.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nearby objects won't be imprisoned forever anymore.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The same thing happens with the electric charge. Make it too large, and our ironclad jail will break open.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If we manage to destroy the event horizon, the singularity would still be there, and objects would still naturally fall towards it.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you hit it, you would still die horribly and quickly.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But the vicinity of the singularity won't be an inescapable prison anymore. You could get as close as you want and come back.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This should count as destroying the black hole. Can we do it?

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
All we have to do is to overcharge or overspin the black hole.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We could do this by throwing objects with a small mass and a lot of charge or angular momentum so that the charge or spin increases faster than the mass.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We have to overfeed the black hole until it reaches the point where it breaks open.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
However, whether you can actually do this is the subject of passionate argument among physicists.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Think of a charged black hole.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Equal charges repel each other, and the more of the same charges you squish together, the more they push back.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So let's say that we have a negatively charged black hole and we want to overfeed it with electrons, for example, whose charge is far larger than its mass.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The electrons will feel an electrostatic repulsion, and the more electrons we throw, the larger the negative charge of the black hole will be and the stronger the repulsion.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But once we reach the upper limit, the electrostatic repulsion will be so strong that it won't allow any more electrons to come in.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
At this point, the black hole will refuse to be overfed.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
With the spin, it's similar. Once the black hole reaches its upper limit, it won't gobble more spin.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But some scientists have discovered what looks like a loophole.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If an instant before the black hole reaches the limit, we throw the right amount of matter in in just the right way, it looks like we could actually overfeed it.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Most scientists are skeptical, but let's give it a try anyway.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The end. Breaking physics.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There is a catch, though. The event horizon of a black hole hides the singularity.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So destroying the horizon would leave us with a naked singularity, one that is not hidden by an event horizon.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And this poses a problem. It could mean the end of physics as we know it.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's a big dirty secret about black holes. Contrary to widespread belief, the singularity of a black hole is not really at its center.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No. It's in the future of whatever crosses the horizon.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Black holes warp the universe so drastically that at the event horizon, space and time switch their roles.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Once you cross it, falling towards the center means going towards the future.

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's why you can't escape.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Stopping your fall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So the singularity is actually in your future, not in front of you.

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And just like you can't see your own future, you won't see the singularity until you hit it.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But you also can't hit something that's in your future, only sort of experience it, like you'll experience your next birthday when it happens.

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Singularities that are in the future are not a problem because we can't see them or interact with them.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But a naked singularity would be in front of us for all of us to see. What would we see?

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, the whole point is that it's impossible to know.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A singularity is a region of infinite gravity and gravity is the bending of space-time.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
At a singularity, the bending is so radical that the fabric of space-time is literally broken.

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Space and time don't exist anymore.

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This means that you can't predict anything since predicting means making a forecast about where and when something will happen.

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But where and when have lost their meaning.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So we have an unpredictable thing with infinite gravity and therefore infinite energy.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This means that anything could come out of it for no reason, from a pile of bananas to lost socks or a solar system.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Predictability, causality, and physics as we know it would break down.

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We think that singularities should exist in nature because we can prove that under very general conditions, gravitational collapse leads to the formation of singularities.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
However, scientists think that nature forbids the formation of naked singularities.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Something enforces the creation of an event horizon around them to prevent their insanity from infecting the rest of the universe.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Without event horizons, physics may not make sense at all.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So although black holes have been portrayed as the ultimate monsters of the universe, they may actually be the heroes that keep us safe from the madness of singularities.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So if we do destroy the horizon, we might destroy the fundamental rules of the universe.

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know what? Let's not do that.

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
As far as we know, there's just one safe method to destroy a black hole.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All black holes emit tiny particles, a phenomenon called Hawking radiation.

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This process causes them to slowly lose mass until they eventually evaporate, leaving behind no horizon and no naked singularity.

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The time it takes for a black hole to completely evaporate depends on its mass.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
For our mini black hole, the size of a speck of dust, it will be about 10 to the power of 44 years.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
10 billion, trillion, trillion times the present age of the universe.

94
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So is it possible to destroy a black hole?

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, we just have to wait.

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But you don't have to wait that long.

97
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
