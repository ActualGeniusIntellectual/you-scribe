00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Fauna and flora on Earth are incredibly diverse.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,500
About 8.7 million eukaryotic species are estimated to live here.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,700
Then again, not that diverse.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,100
Around 1.5 million animals have been catalogued so far.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,400
Almost 1 million are insects.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,800
So if you wanted to showcase a condensed selection with just 100 animals,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,400
65 spots would be taken by insects,

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,100
and mammals wouldn't even get a spot of their own.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,500
But numbers aren't everything.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
It's the junctions that life has taken,

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
and the different species that sprang from common ancestors,

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
that make evolution so astounding.
