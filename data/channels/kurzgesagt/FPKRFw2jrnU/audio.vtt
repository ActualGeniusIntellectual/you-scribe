00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Fauna and flora on Earth are incredibly diverse.

00:03.200 --> 00:07.500
About 8.7 million eukaryotic species are estimated to live here.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.700
Then again, not that diverse.

00:09.700 --> 00:13.100
Around 1.5 million animals have been catalogued so far.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.400
Almost 1 million are insects.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.800
So if you wanted to showcase a condensed selection with just 100 animals,

00:19.800 --> 00:22.400
65 spots would be taken by insects,

00:22.400 --> 00:25.100
and mammals wouldn't even get a spot of their own.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.500
But numbers aren't everything.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.500
It's the junctions that life has taken,

00:30.500 --> 00:33.500
and the different species that sprang from common ancestors,

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
that make evolution so astounding.
