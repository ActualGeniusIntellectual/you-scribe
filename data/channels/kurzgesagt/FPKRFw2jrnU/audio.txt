Fauna and flora on Earth are incredibly diverse.
About 8.7 million eukaryotic species are estimated to live here.
Then again, not that diverse.
Around 1.5 million animals have been catalogued so far.
Almost 1 million are insects.
So if you wanted to showcase a condensed selection with just 100 animals,
65 spots would be taken by insects,
and mammals wouldn't even get a spot of their own.
But numbers aren't everything.
It's the junctions that life has taken,
and the different species that sprang from common ancestors,
that make evolution so astounding.
