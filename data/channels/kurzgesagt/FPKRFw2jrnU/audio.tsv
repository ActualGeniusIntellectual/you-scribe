0	3200	Fauna and flora on Earth are incredibly diverse.
3200	7500	About 8.7 million eukaryotic species are estimated to live here.
7500	9700	Then again, not that diverse.
9700	13100	Around 1.5 million animals have been catalogued so far.
13100	15400	Almost 1 million are insects.
15400	19800	So if you wanted to showcase a condensed selection with just 100 animals,
19800	22400	65 spots would be taken by insects,
22400	25100	and mammals wouldn't even get a spot of their own.
26800	28500	But numbers aren't everything.
28500	30500	It's the junctions that life has taken,
30500	33500	and the different species that sprang from common ancestors,
33500	36000	that make evolution so astounding.
