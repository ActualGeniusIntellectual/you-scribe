00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Human society is extremely complex and fragile, built upon various pillars.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,400
One of them is the honeybee. One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people starving in the following

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
years. On top of that, honeybees have a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,080
pollinated by them each year is around 265 billion. Food we take for granted would just

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,200
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive decrease in productivity. Food including

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,400
apples, onions, pumpkins, and also plants used for feeding livestock are thus extremely important for

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,240
our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, if honeybees die out, humans will

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,360
follow a few years later. Actually, he probably didn't say that, but there might be some truth

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,440
in the statement. It's unsettling, but honeybees have started to disappear. Millions of hives have

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,240
died in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30 to 90%

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,880
of their colonies. In the US alone, bees are steadily declining, from 5 million hives in 1988

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,080
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder has affected

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,760
honeybees in many countries, and we're not entirely sure what's causing it. All we know

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:37,600
is that it's pretty serious. Over the last few decades, bees have seen an invasion of very

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,400
dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie, like a carapace woody. Microscopic mites

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,000
that infect the trachea, that's the breathing tubes, of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,120
feed from the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending their whole life

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,280
inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,040
hives and are one of the bee's greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honeybee brood cell and

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,320
lays eggs on the bee larva before it's about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the cell

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,840
with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and their mother feed on the developing bee

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,960
in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed at this stage, just weakened,

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,360
so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the wax capping and release itself from

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,800
the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite and her new offspring from the cell and these are

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,240
free to spread across the hive, starting the process over again in a cycle of about 10 days.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Their numbers grow exponentially and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse of the

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,440
entire beehive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the bodily fluids of bees and

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,800
weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit viruses that harm the bees

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
even more and can lead to birth defects like useless wings. But there are other threats too,

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,760
such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these phenomena should be

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,120
manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Over recent years, new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,840
Neonicotinoids, a chemical family similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s as

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,080
an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming their nervous systems. Today,

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,080
they are the most widely used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,840
euros in 2008, representing 24% of the global market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,160
were used in the US on about 95% of corn and canola crops and also on the vast majority of

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,120
fruit and vegetables like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes,

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,400
potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,440
while collecting pollen or via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive

43
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,760
where it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a variety of

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,600
horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,880
even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world,

46
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,120
so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,800
often enough, a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an alternative to it. But there are billions of

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
dollars to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically

50
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,160
appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees compared to those produced by independent

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,880
scientists. There are even more factors contributing to the demise of bees, like too

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,640
much genetic uniformity, crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding, stress because of

53
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,160
human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for

54
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,000
bees, but together, they probably account for colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,960
their game in recent decades, the honey bees are now fighting for survival. It would be a

56
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,440
catastrophe if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve if we want to continue

57
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,440
living with a relative abundance and diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with

58
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,800
Earth and the other life forms on it. Even if we pretend that we're not, we have to take better

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,920
care of our surroundings. If not to preserve the beauty of nature, then at least to ensure our own

60
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,880
survival. This video is supported by the Australian Academy of Science, which promotes and supports
