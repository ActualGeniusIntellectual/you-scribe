00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Human society is extremely complex and fragile, built upon various pillars.

00:05.680 --> 00:12.400
One of them is the honeybee. One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.160
They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,

00:16.160 --> 00:20.960
thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people starving in the following

00:20.960 --> 00:26.320
years. On top of that, honeybees have a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants

00:26.320 --> 00:32.080
pollinated by them each year is around 265 billion. Food we take for granted would just

00:32.080 --> 00:37.200
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive decrease in productivity. Food including

00:37.200 --> 00:42.400
apples, onions, pumpkins, and also plants used for feeding livestock are thus extremely important for

00:42.400 --> 00:48.240
our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, if honeybees die out, humans will

00:48.240 --> 00:53.360
follow a few years later. Actually, he probably didn't say that, but there might be some truth

00:53.360 --> 00:59.440
in the statement. It's unsettling, but honeybees have started to disappear. Millions of hives have

00:59.440 --> 01:06.240
died in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30 to 90%

01:06.240 --> 01:12.880
of their colonies. In the US alone, bees are steadily declining, from 5 million hives in 1988

01:12.880 --> 01:20.080
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder has affected

01:20.080 --> 01:25.760
honeybees in many countries, and we're not entirely sure what's causing it. All we know

01:25.760 --> 01:37.600
is that it's pretty serious. Over the last few decades, bees have seen an invasion of very

01:37.600 --> 01:44.400
dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie, like a carapace woody. Microscopic mites

01:44.400 --> 01:50.000
that infect the trachea, that's the breathing tubes, of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and

01:50.000 --> 01:55.120
feed from the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending their whole life

01:55.120 --> 02:01.280
inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee

02:01.280 --> 02:07.040
hives and are one of the bee's greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honeybee brood cell and

02:07.040 --> 02:12.320
lays eggs on the bee larva before it's about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the cell

02:12.320 --> 02:17.840
with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and their mother feed on the developing bee

02:17.840 --> 02:22.960
in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed at this stage, just weakened,

02:22.960 --> 02:27.360
so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the wax capping and release itself from

02:27.360 --> 02:32.800
the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite and her new offspring from the cell and these are

02:32.800 --> 02:38.240
free to spread across the hive, starting the process over again in a cycle of about 10 days.

02:38.240 --> 02:43.120
Their numbers grow exponentially and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse of the

02:43.120 --> 02:49.440
entire beehive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the bodily fluids of bees and

02:49.440 --> 02:54.800
weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit viruses that harm the bees

02:54.800 --> 03:00.480
even more and can lead to birth defects like useless wings. But there are other threats too,

03:00.480 --> 03:05.760
such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these phenomena should be

03:05.760 --> 03:11.120
manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.

03:11.120 --> 03:16.160
Over recent years, new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.840
Neonicotinoids, a chemical family similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s as

03:21.840 --> 03:28.080
an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming their nervous systems. Today,

03:28.080 --> 03:34.080
they are the most widely used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion

03:34.080 --> 03:41.840
euros in 2008, representing 24% of the global market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids

03:41.840 --> 03:48.160
were used in the US on about 95% of corn and canola crops and also on the vast majority of

03:48.160 --> 03:55.120
fruit and vegetables like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes,

03:55.120 --> 04:02.400
potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin

04:02.400 --> 04:07.440
while collecting pollen or via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive

04:07.440 --> 04:13.760
where it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a variety of

04:13.760 --> 04:19.600
horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But

04:19.600 --> 04:24.880
even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world,

04:24.880 --> 04:31.120
so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens

04:31.120 --> 04:36.800
often enough, a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids

04:36.800 --> 04:42.000
are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an alternative to it. But there are billions of

04:42.000 --> 04:47.040
dollars to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically

04:47.040 --> 04:52.160
appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees compared to those produced by independent

04:52.160 --> 04:56.880
scientists. There are even more factors contributing to the demise of bees, like too

04:56.880 --> 05:02.640
much genetic uniformity, crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding, stress because of

05:02.640 --> 05:08.160
human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for

05:08.160 --> 05:14.000
bees, but together, they probably account for colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping

05:14.000 --> 05:18.960
their game in recent decades, the honey bees are now fighting for survival. It would be a

05:18.960 --> 05:25.440
catastrophe if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve if we want to continue

05:25.440 --> 05:31.440
living with a relative abundance and diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with

05:31.440 --> 05:36.800
Earth and the other life forms on it. Even if we pretend that we're not, we have to take better

05:36.800 --> 05:41.920
care of our surroundings. If not to preserve the beauty of nature, then at least to ensure our own

05:41.920 --> 05:48.880
survival. This video is supported by the Australian Academy of Science, which promotes and supports
