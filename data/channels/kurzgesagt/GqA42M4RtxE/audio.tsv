0	5680	Human society is extremely complex and fragile, built upon various pillars.
5680	12400	One of them is the honeybee. One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees.
12400	16160	They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,
16160	20960	thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people starving in the following
20960	26320	years. On top of that, honeybees have a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants
26320	32080	pollinated by them each year is around 265 billion. Food we take for granted would just
32080	37200	stop existing without them, or there would be a massive decrease in productivity. Food including
37200	42400	apples, onions, pumpkins, and also plants used for feeding livestock are thus extremely important for
42400	48240	our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, if honeybees die out, humans will
48240	53360	follow a few years later. Actually, he probably didn't say that, but there might be some truth
53360	59440	in the statement. It's unsettling, but honeybees have started to disappear. Millions of hives have
59440	66240	died in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30 to 90%
66240	72880	of their colonies. In the US alone, bees are steadily declining, from 5 million hives in 1988
72880	80080	to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder has affected
80080	85760	honeybees in many countries, and we're not entirely sure what's causing it. All we know
85760	97600	is that it's pretty serious. Over the last few decades, bees have seen an invasion of very
97600	104400	dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie, like a carapace woody. Microscopic mites
104400	110000	that infect the trachea, that's the breathing tubes, of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and
110000	115120	feed from the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending their whole life
115120	121280	inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee
121280	127040	hives and are one of the bee's greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honeybee brood cell and
127040	132320	lays eggs on the bee larva before it's about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the cell
132320	137840	with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and their mother feed on the developing bee
137840	142960	in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed at this stage, just weakened,
142960	147360	so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the wax capping and release itself from
147360	152800	the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite and her new offspring from the cell and these are
152800	158240	free to spread across the hive, starting the process over again in a cycle of about 10 days.
158240	163120	Their numbers grow exponentially and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse of the
163120	169440	entire beehive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the bodily fluids of bees and
169440	174800	weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit viruses that harm the bees
174800	180480	even more and can lead to birth defects like useless wings. But there are other threats too,
180480	185760	such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these phenomena should be
185760	191120	manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.
191120	196160	Over recent years, new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees.
196160	201840	Neonicotinoids, a chemical family similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s as
201840	208080	an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming their nervous systems. Today,
208080	214080	they are the most widely used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion
214080	221840	euros in 2008, representing 24% of the global market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids
221840	228160	were used in the US on about 95% of corn and canola crops and also on the vast majority of
228160	235120	fruit and vegetables like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes,
235120	242400	potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin
242400	247440	while collecting pollen or via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive
247440	253760	where it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a variety of
253760	259600	horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But
259600	264880	even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world,
264880	271120	so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens
271120	276800	often enough, a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids
276800	282000	are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an alternative to it. But there are billions of
282000	287040	dollars to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically
287040	292160	appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees compared to those produced by independent
292160	296880	scientists. There are even more factors contributing to the demise of bees, like too
296880	302640	much genetic uniformity, crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding, stress because of
302640	308160	human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for
308160	314000	bees, but together, they probably account for colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping
314000	318960	their game in recent decades, the honey bees are now fighting for survival. It would be a
318960	325440	catastrophe if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve if we want to continue
325440	331440	living with a relative abundance and diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with
331440	336800	Earth and the other life forms on it. Even if we pretend that we're not, we have to take better
336800	341920	care of our surroundings. If not to preserve the beauty of nature, then at least to ensure our own
341920	348880	survival. This video is supported by the Australian Academy of Science, which promotes and supports
