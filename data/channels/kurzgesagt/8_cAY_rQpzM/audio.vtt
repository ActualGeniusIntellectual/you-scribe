Earth is a sphere, maps are flat, so how do you get Earth on a map?

00:07.360 --> 00:12.800
You have to stretch, bend, or compress parts, which is called projection.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.920
For different purposes, some projections are better suited than others.

00:16.920 --> 00:22.280
Sailors, for example, need maps on which they can draw courses as they appear in real life.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.480
But that means Greenland looks as big as Africa.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.920
Hundreds of projections exist.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.120
Look at a different one once in a while, so you remember they are all just one perspective

00:33.120 --> 00:34.640
on reality.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.680
Get inspired by what humanity has built, and look at some very special places.
