00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Earth is a sphere, maps are flat, so how do you get Earth on a map?

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,800
You have to stretch, bend, or compress parts, which is called projection.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,920
For different purposes, some projections are better suited than others.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,280
Sailors, for example, need maps on which they can draw courses as they appear in real life.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,480
But that means Greenland looks as big as Africa.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,920
Hundreds of projections exist.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,120
Look at a different one once in a while, so you remember they are all just one perspective

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,640
on reality.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,680
Get inspired by what humanity has built, and look at some very special places.
