0	6760	Cutting sandwiches with much science. With a single straight cut, can you half a three-ingredient sandwich with all components perfectly halved?
7340	13500	There's actually real science about this, called the ham sandwich theorem. And the answer might seem obvious when you're looking at a theoretical
13900	19660	symmetrical sandwich, but in reality sandwiches are messy. But maths doesn't care about messiness, it still works.
19980	23560	It doesn't matter what form the three ingredients have or how they're positioned.
23860	28340	Imagine a slice of bread in Munich, Germany, a slice of ham at a farmers market in San Francisco,
28340	31440	USA, and a slice of cheese in a lunchbox on a plane to Indonesia.
31940	38180	Although this might not be a sandwich in the classical sense, there is a single perfect cut that halves all three slices at once.
38300	40900	We just need a very big knife. And there's more.
41060	46600	Maths says there's always a perfect cut for a four-piece sandwich in a four-dimensional space, same for a five-piece sandwich in a
46780	52120	five-dimensional space, and so on. Thanks maths. Now any multi-dimensional civilization can be
