Cutting sandwiches with much science. With a single straight cut, can you half a three-ingredient sandwich with all components perfectly halved?

There's actually real science about this, called the ham sandwich theorem. And the answer might seem obvious when you're looking at a theoretical

00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,660
symmetrical sandwich, but in reality sandwiches are messy. But maths doesn't care about messiness, it still works.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,560
It doesn't matter what form the three ingredients have or how they're positioned.

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,340
Imagine a slice of bread in Munich, Germany, a slice of ham at a farmers market in San Francisco,

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,440
USA, and a slice of cheese in a lunchbox on a plane to Indonesia.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,180
Although this might not be a sandwich in the classical sense, there is a single perfect cut that halves all three slices at once.

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,900
We just need a very big knife. And there's more.

00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,600
Maths says there's always a perfect cut for a four-piece sandwich in a four-dimensional space, same for a five-piece sandwich in a

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,120
five-dimensional space, and so on. Thanks maths. Now any multi-dimensional civilization can be
