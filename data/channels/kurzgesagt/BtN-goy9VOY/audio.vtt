00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
In December 2019, the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading

00:05.240 --> 00:06.840
through their communities.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.680
In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.920
This virus is the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 that causes

00:16.920 --> 00:22.000
the disease called COVID-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.720
What actually happens when it infects a human, and what should we all do?

00:30.000 --> 00:40.140
A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not

00:40.140 --> 00:41.860
even a living thing.

00:41.860 --> 00:45.780
It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.

00:45.780 --> 00:50.700
Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them.

00:50.700 --> 00:54.940
Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection, when people cough, or if you touch

00:54.940 --> 00:59.540
someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose.

00:59.540 --> 01:04.000
The virus starts its journey here and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into

01:04.000 --> 01:05.420
the body.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.280
Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen, or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic

01:10.280 --> 01:11.600
effect.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.080
Even just a few coronaviruses can cause quite a dramatic situation.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.840
The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells.

01:19.840 --> 01:26.080
These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa, waiting to be infected.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.660
Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victims' membranes to inject its genetic

01:30.660 --> 01:31.860
material.

01:31.860 --> 01:36.780
The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple,

01:36.780 --> 01:39.100
copy and reassemble.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.300
It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical

01:43.300 --> 01:47.700
point and receives one final order, self-destruct.

01:47.700 --> 01:53.860
The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles, ready to attack more cells.

01:53.860 --> 01:57.440
The number of infected cells grows exponentially.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.680
After about ten days, millions of body cells are infected and billions of viruses swarm

02:02.680 --> 02:04.160
the lungs.

02:04.160 --> 02:09.100
The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real

02:09.100 --> 02:12.280
beast on you, your own immune system.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.720
The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself

02:16.720 --> 02:19.260
and needs tight regulation.

02:19.260 --> 02:24.440
And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, corona infects some of them

02:24.440 --> 02:27.040
and creates confusion.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.720
Cells have neither ears nor eyes.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.200
They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.200
Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.400
Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.220
In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers

02:46.220 --> 02:50.400
than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.600
Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.920
First, neutrophiles, which are great at killing stuff, including ourselves.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.660
As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends

03:03.660 --> 03:05.400
as enemies.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.040
The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T cells, which usually

03:10.040 --> 03:14.080
order infected cells to commit controlled suicide.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.700
Just as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too.

03:18.700 --> 03:22.660
The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy

03:22.660 --> 03:24.760
lung tissue they kill.

03:24.760 --> 03:29.780
This might get so bad that it can cause permanent, irreversible damage that leads to lifelong

03:29.780 --> 03:31.300
disabilities.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.100
In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control.

03:35.100 --> 03:39.820
It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones, and cleans

03:39.820 --> 03:41.660
up the battlefield.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.940
Recovery begins.

03:42.940 --> 03:48.680
The majority of people infected by corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.140
But many cases become severe or even critical.

03:52.140 --> 03:55.880
We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe

03:55.880 --> 03:59.080
to say that there is a lot more than with the flu.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.620
In more severe cases, millions of epithelial cells have died, and with them, the lung's

04:03.620 --> 04:06.000
protective lining is gone.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.680
That means that the alveoli, tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs, can be infected

04:10.680 --> 04:14.380
by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem.

04:14.380 --> 04:19.660
Patients get pneumonia, respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators

04:19.660 --> 04:21.440
to survive.

04:21.440 --> 04:27.140
The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons.

04:27.140 --> 04:31.300
And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.120
They enter the blood and overrun the body.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.320
If this happens, death is very likely.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.720
The coronavirus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it is much more dangerous.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.140
While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for

04:47.140 --> 04:52.420
sure that it is much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu.

04:52.420 --> 04:57.340
There are two futures for a pandemic like corona, fast and slow.

04:57.340 --> 05:02.660
Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak.

05:02.660 --> 05:06.780
A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives.

05:06.780 --> 05:10.640
A slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.400
The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection

05:15.400 --> 05:19.000
because there are no countermeasures in place to slow it down.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.740
Why is this so bad?

05:20.740 --> 05:24.800
In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time.

05:24.800 --> 05:29.280
If the numbers get too large, healthcare systems become unable to handle it.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.260
There aren't enough resources like medical staff or equipment like ventilators left to

05:33.260 --> 05:34.840
help everybody.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.020
People will die untreated.

05:37.020 --> 05:42.180
And as more healthcare workers get sick themselves, the capacity of healthcare systems falls even

05:42.180 --> 05:43.180
further.

05:43.180 --> 05:48.120
If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live

05:48.120 --> 05:49.720
and who doesn't.

05:49.720 --> 05:54.300
The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario.

05:54.300 --> 05:59.540
To avoid this, the world, that means all of us, needs to do what it can to turn this into

05:59.540 --> 06:01.540
a slow pandemic.

06:01.540 --> 06:07.240
A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses, especially in the early phase, so that everyone

06:07.240 --> 06:12.660
who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals.

06:12.660 --> 06:17.840
Since we don't have a vaccine for corona, we have to socially engineer our behavior

06:17.840 --> 06:20.480
to act like a social vaccine.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.960
This simply means two things.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.600
Not getting infected and not infecting others.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.240
Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.000
Soap is actually a powerful tool.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.020
The coronavirus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat.

06:38.020 --> 06:42.140
Soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you.

06:42.140 --> 06:46.740
It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses

06:46.740 --> 06:48.380
are ripped away.

06:48.380 --> 06:53.020
To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeÃ±os and want to put

06:53.020 --> 06:55.400
in your contacts next.

06:55.400 --> 07:00.260
The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing

07:00.260 --> 07:01.340
to do.

07:01.340 --> 07:04.100
This means no hugging, no handshakes.

07:04.100 --> 07:09.760
If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.880
From doctors to cashiers or police officers.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.460
You depend on all of them.

07:14.460 --> 07:17.860
They all depend on you to not get sick.

07:17.860 --> 07:21.660
On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things from travel

07:21.660 --> 07:25.180
restrictions or actual orders to stay at home.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.680
Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular.

07:28.760 --> 07:33.780
They buy us, and especially the researchers working on medication and vaccination, crucial

07:33.780 --> 07:34.780
time.

07:34.780 --> 07:39.720
So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why and respect it.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.600
None of this is fun.

07:41.600 --> 07:46.120
But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay.

07:46.120 --> 07:50.160
The question of how pandemics end depends on how they start.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.820
If they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly.

07:53.820 --> 07:58.380
If they start slow with a not-so-steep slope, they end okayish.

07:58.380 --> 08:02.540
And in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands.

08:02.540 --> 08:06.260
Literally and figuratively.

08:06.260 --> 08:10.620
A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, especially

08:10.620 --> 08:15.000
Our World in Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest

08:15.000 --> 08:17.860
problems and how to make progress solving them.

08:17.860 --> 08:18.860
Check out their site.

08:18.860 --> 08:23.220
It also includes a constantly updated page on the corona pandemic.
