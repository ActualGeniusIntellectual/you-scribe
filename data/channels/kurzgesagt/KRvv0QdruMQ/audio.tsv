640	6480	When we think about alien civilizations, we tend to look into the vastness of space,
6480	12800	to faraway planets. But, there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be
12800	19920	giving too little thought to. Time. Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years,
19920	28080	other civilizations existed on Earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out,
28080	31600	and that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet?
32560	36320	What does science have to say about this, and what are the implications for us?
46240	51760	Life on Earth has existed for 4 billion years. Mostly as single-celled organisms,
51760	58560	until some 540 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion heralded the age of animals,
58560	64240	a huge time window for our indigenous aliens. Where would we look for them, and what could we
64240	72240	hope to find? Sadly, we have only one civilization to look at ourselves. Anatomically modern humans
72240	77280	emerged around 300,000 years ago, and probably lived in small groups of hunter-gatherers,
77280	83200	slowly spreading around the world. Progress was slow, and our lifestyle didn't change much,
83200	89040	although there may have been local bursts of complexity. Until about 10,000 years ago,
89040	94560	when the agricultural revolution changed our lifestyle forever, enabling massive population
94560	100080	growth and technological progress. Rather than just animals with culture and tools that would
100080	105440	have been invisible from space, we changed the face of the planet, cleared forests, and constructed
105440	112880	cities and temples for our gods, at breathtaking speeds and scales. Until about 300 years ago,
112880	119600	we became an industrial species, and yet again our numbers grew exponentially, as did our impact on
119600	126880	the planet. We could say that our 300,000-year-long history has three phases. We were hunter-gatherers
126880	137120	for 97%, farmers for 2.9%, and industrialists for 0.1% of our history. And yet, we are super new on
137120	145280	Earth. On geological timescales, even the sturdiest things lose their durability. The oldest large-scale
145280	151440	surface is the Negev Desert, a meager 1.8 million years old. Everything older has been crushed to
151440	157840	dust or turned over, and it's either below the ground or covered by ice or ocean. Our age, the
157840	164800	Anthropocene, will be a layer only a few centimeters thick in a few million years. If there were aliens
164800	170800	before us and they too went through these three phases, what would remain of them? What can we
170800	179600	learn about indigenous aliens by looking at ourselves? Hunter-gatherer aliens. We actually know
179600	185040	that in the last few million years there were hunter-gatherer aliens. Our ancestors, like Homo
185040	190080	erectus, and cousins like the Neanderthals or Denisovans, and probably many more that we haven't
190080	196800	found yet, are lost to time forever. They left fragments of their bodies, of weapons and tools,
196800	202400	and even art. Considering how long they existed and how little remains of them, although they
202400	208400	lived not that far from our present, it's easy to think there have been others. Intelligent animals
208400	215040	like us that could talk and use tools and fire that had culture and art. For the last two million
215040	220560	years, most hominins lived as hunter-gatherers. So if these aliens never moved up higher on the
220560	225200	tech tree, hundreds of different species and cultures could have existed without leaving any
225200	232880	traces. Their artifacts lost to biological and then geological processes. At worst, they would
232880	238320	leave absolutely nothing to be found after thousands of years. But what about fossils?
238880	243920	We talked about how unlikely the process of fossilization is in more detail in our dinosaur
243920	250000	video. But in a nutshell, per 100,000 years of Earth's history, we only get a handful of good
250000	256560	fossils. So we might easily just miss fossils of such people, but even if we had any, we wouldn't
256560	263120	necessarily be able to identify them as hunter-gatherers. Agricultural and empire aliens.
264080	269280	Looking at humans again, agricultural societies left much more to be dug up and found because
269280	274080	they used more sophisticated tools made from sturdier materials and had to feed millions,
274080	280000	leaving many more artifacts. Farming allowed them to specialize and develop tech from writing to
280000	286560	navigation, architecture, and government. Over thousands of years, city-states became kingdoms
286560	292880	and empires, some existing for millennia before they fell. Many of the buildings or monuments
292880	298480	they constructed are still around, and traces of them will exist for a few thousand more years,
299280	304480	some only as outlines in the ground but still recognizable to future archaeologists.
305280	310320	The pyramids are piles of limestone so massive that they will probably be around for hundreds
310320	316160	of thousands of years. And because of the greater numbers of humans that lived during our farm and
316160	321520	empire period, we can expect way more fossils and artifacts to be detectable, maybe for a few
321520	327200	million years before they vanish. So we can say with confidence that no such indigenous alien
327200	332320	civilization existed in the last few million years, because otherwise we would have found
332320	337920	something that they left. This still leaves a window of hundreds of millions of years,
337920	341680	back to the emergence of complex life where we wouldn't be able to tell.
342560	347600	If there were alien pre-industrial societies and empires on the level of the ancient Romans or
347600	353360	Chinese, they would have likely disappeared without a trace. Their tools, even advanced
353360	358800	metals, would have rotted away. If they dug up canals, cleared forests, and built cities,
358800	364000	their traces would be very hard to distinguish from nature. Maybe there was once an empire of
364000	369280	cephalopods occupying impressive cities in swamps and lakes made from wood and stone.
370240	376240	Their engineers flooding land to build wet cities, their poets reciting poems in a language of
376240	382560	colors. Maybe they never industrialized. Maybe their society was too stable or not inventive
382560	388560	enough or they never got a chance. A single event like an asteroid, an epidemic, or an ice age,
388560	394320	could just have deleted their civilization, ground up their temples, as their soft bodies rotted
394320	401280	away. Sadly, we don't have the tiniest amount of evidence for any such civilization. After a few
401280	407360	million years at best, their achievements would have dissolved into nothing. Industrial
407360	414560	indigenous aliens. What about industrial civilizations like humanity today? Imagine
414560	421280	humans died out suddenly through a pandemic or cosmic rays or something like that. What
421280	427840	would remain? Our impact on the planet is orders of magnitude greater than that of our ancestors.
427840	433360	The fossil record will show a great extinction of wildlife and an explosion of fossils from human
433360	440080	associated animals like rats, cows, pigs, and chickens. Like the structures of our ancestors,
440080	445360	skyscrapers and streets and hard drives will basically crumble into nothingness in a few
445360	450800	millennia. But because there were so many humans everywhere, for a few million years after our
450800	456640	sudden end, there would be clear hints of our existence. The byproducts of our industrial
456640	462720	lifestyle might actually give us away for some hundreds of millions of years. We use massive
462720	467920	amounts of artificial fertilizer which redirects Earth's flow of nitrogen that is being deposited
467920	473920	in the soil. Mining metals and rare earth elements leaves long-term scars and depletes
473920	479840	natural resources. We saturate our oceans with plastics that find their way to the ocean floor
479840	485760	and may persist for hundreds of millions of years. There are radioactive elements and their decay,
485760	492000	unnatural accumulations of elements that don't exist outside labs or weapons. And of course,
492000	497520	in our short industrial history, we have changed the proportion of CO2 in the air by burning
497520	503840	massive amounts of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity of the oceans, and so on. We may already
503840	510400	have left a mark in the geological record. So far, we have found no traces of an industrial
510400	517040	alien civilization, no layers of weird chemicals or displaced elements, no radioactive layer to
517040	523760	indicate that once great nations waged nuclear war. We do see mass extinctions and massive shifts
523760	529600	in the fossil records, but no evidence that they did not occur naturally. And ironically,
529600	535200	we've hit upon an interesting problem here. If industrial societies stress the ecosystem enough
535200	540800	to cause their own extinction, they won't be around that long. But if they become sustainable,
540800	546960	their imprint on the geological record may be tiny. If past industrial civilizations were
546960	551840	sustainable before they died out, we may have little to no chance of ever knowing about them.
552640	557840	In any case, over hundreds of millions of years, these signatures may become very subtle
557840	564880	and get overlooked or interpreted as natural. Even if an industrialized alien society existed
564880	571760	200 million years ago and lasted for 100,000 years, 300 times longer than industrial humanity,
571760	577440	it still might be easy to miss it in the geological record. In any case, all of this
577440	583200	is speculation. In the end, we shouldn't use our imagination to trick ourselves into thinking
583200	588080	we know anything about our blind spots. Just assuming a thing happened because we don't
588080	594720	have evidence against it is a trap we should avoid. So for now, if we look at the vastness
594720	602160	of time, it seems as devoid of aliens as the vastness of space. Maybe we are alone in this
602160	608000	universe and always were. Maybe we'll find traces of others eventually, we don't know.
608960	613920	But there is one important takeaway. The continuation of our civilization is not
613920	620640	guaranteed. And if we're not careful, we may disappear forever. Let's hope that in a few
620640	626400	million years, there isn't another civilization studying our layer in the fossil record.
626400	633040	It's frustrating to know there are so many things in our past we can't access.
