1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The universe today is happy and healthy, with exciting things going on.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But at some point, the night will turn dark.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Everything that once was will peacefully sleep forever.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But what is the last thing that will ever happen, and when will it be?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It turns out there is such a thing, and you probably haven't heard about it.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's travel to the end of the universe and look at the last thing.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
After a messy birth, our universe was a sleepy baby, warm and dark, filled with swirling clouds of hot hydrogen and helium.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The story of creation is a story of this gas and where it will end up.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Shortly after, the universe got busy making the first generation of stars.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They were massive and lived violent lives, forging new elements, only to release most of them when they blew up.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Countless stars were born and refined the gas available in the universe, cycling matter around,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
each generation giving most of its gas and fresh elements to the next.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But not all gas is returned.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Every time a new generation of stars forms, they also make more and more red dwarfs that burn slowly and live for trillions of years.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When they die, they don't give their gas back to the universe, but turn into white dwarfs.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So red dwarfs lock up more gas forever.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So more gas is locked forever in other remains of dead stars, neutron stars and black holes,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which is bad as it reduces the material available for new stars.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Today, the universe is a great home for us and will remain so for billions of years.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But most of the gas has been used up or trapped.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Over 90% of the stars that will ever be born have been born already.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To get to the last thing to ever happen, all other things need to happen first.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The next few hundred billion years will be fun and a great time for galactic exploration.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But step by step, large stars and stars like our Sun will die out.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Eventually, almost all the stars will be red dwarfs slowly dying.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The end of everything, but not quite.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In a few trillion years, the cosmic gas will finally have run out.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
About 88% of the mass of every galaxy will be white dwarfs, 2% neutron stars and black holes,

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and about 10% gas giants and sad brown dwarf losers.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
White dwarfs are the corpses of old stars, not much bigger than Earth,

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but on average as massive as half our Sun, some even much more.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This makes them the third densest objects in the universe, after neutron stars and black holes.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
About a million times denser than the Sun today.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Since they used to be active stars, their surface can be as hot as 150,000 degrees.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
White dwarfs are dim, hot, dense spheres that don't do anything anymore.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But eventually, even white dwarfs will die because they're slowly losing their heat.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It takes at least 10 trillion years, more than 700 times longer than the current age of the universe.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
As they do their cooling down, the universe around them will irreversibly grow dark,

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
as more and more white dwarfs burn out and turn into dead husks, black dwarfs.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Spheres of death, as cold as space itself, invisible against the dark backdrop.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Over trillions and trillions of years, every object in every galaxy is eventually either ejected into the void,

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
or its orbit decays and it will fall into the central black hole and be destroyed.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In about a quintillion years, all galaxies have evaporated and every object is on its own,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
in the center of its own observable universe, emptiness as far as can be seen in any direction,

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
traveling through black nothingness.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Still, there are things that will happen.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Black holes are dying, slowly.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They'll fizzle away by emitting Hawking radiation until they're so small that they die in a final flash of light.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This will take about a googol years, 10 to the power of 100 years, until the last supermassive black hole dies.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A number so absurd, there's nothing to compare it to.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Maybe some living beings could have survived around black holes, but even this science fiction option ends now.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
After this unsettling amount of time, we're not even close to the end.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now is the time of the black dwarfs.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It turns out there's some weird physics going on inside the dead husk of stars.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The weird physics of black dwarfs.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A black dwarf is a sphere the size of Earth, as massive as a star, but almost as cold as absolute zero.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Stars stay alive because of their intense heat in their cores, so why do black dwarfs not collapse into a black hole?

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What keeps them together?

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Deep inside a black dwarf, matter is squeezed to densities millions of times greater than anything we see on Earth.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The pressure is so great that electrons can't combine with nuclei to form atoms.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Instead, matter is weird, degenerate.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The nuclei are compressed by the weight of the star, locked into a rigid lattice, while the electrons form a plasma between them.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And these electrons hold the star together.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're simplifying, but imagine matter as a subway train and electrons as passengers.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If there are empty seats, passengers spread out because they care a lot about their personal space.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But as a black dwarf is so incredibly dense, this is like squishing more and more passengers into our train.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gravity is pushing in, trying to collapse it.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The passengers are forced to sit and stand close together, which they hate.

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And so the passengers, our electrons, try to push out against gravity as hard as they can.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This way the electrons that are having a horrible time in the crowded train that's the black dwarf hold up the star.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everything else in the universe may have crumbled already, but these tiny particles push against each other until the end of time.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Or they would, if quantum mechanics didn't ruin everything.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Simplifying a lot, when particles get close enough, sometimes they can jump at each other and fuse together.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A process called quantum tunneling.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This happens constantly in stars because of their intense heat.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's one of the key reasons stars can fuse elements into new ones.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But it also happens at a temperature near absolute zero.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Just, well, mind-numbingly slowly.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is the final step to creating the last interesting thing to ever happen in our universe.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here, in this lone black dwarf, something fantastic occurs.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Nothing happens for a trillion years.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nothing at all.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Can you imagine that?

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But then, a single fusion reaction.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Two carbon nuclei combine by quantum tunneling to become magnesium.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Another 100 trillion years pass.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It happens again.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then nothing for another bazillion years.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, two oxygen nuclei combine into silicon.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
As eons pass, the nuclei in the frozen black dwarf slowly combine, making new heavier nuclei.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And these take even longer to fuse, but given enough time, they eventually will.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Remember the breathtaking amount of time it took for a supermassive black hole to evaporate?

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's a brief moment in comparison to what's going on here.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The difference between a second and trillions of years has lost all meaning.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Over a time so absurd that it has no name, nuclei keep fusing into heavier elements.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Until, when silicon nuclei fuse, they form nickel-56.

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nickel-56 is radioactive, which means it's unstable.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And when it eventually decays and turns into iron, it emits two positrons, antimatter electrons.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And these two positrons find two electrons and annihilate them and themselves.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Which is a problem?

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Remember how the uncomfortable electrons produce the pressure to hold the star together?

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Destroying the electron means fewer friends to help them hold up the star.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Losing an electron does not give them more space to scratch their butts,

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it just makes gravity squeeze harder, the walls closing in on those that remain.

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In the case of the most massive black dwarfs, this is catastrophic.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Bit by bit, the black dwarf turns into a sphere of iron and more electrons are annihilated.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For at least 10 to the power of 1000 years, almost, but not quite forever,

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
there's no visible change in the entire universe.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then, finally, the last thing to ever happen, happens.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The black dwarf has lost one too many electrons.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It can no longer support its immense mass and goes into an uncontrolled collapse, a supernova.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It first implodes and then explodes as bright as a galaxy and fills the empty universe with light again.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A beautiful moment nobody will get to enjoy.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then, as quickly as it began, it's all over. Darkness again. Emptiness.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was the last thing that will ever happen.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The universe may now be truly dead, but don't be bummed out about it.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is so far away in the future that forever hardly describes it.

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Today, the universe is the best place it could be for us.

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you can sleep tight tonight, knowing the last interesting thing that will ever happen is forever long away.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For now, there are still plenty of interesting things to discover.

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And the younger you start discovering, the more you'll understand about the world we live in.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Our sponsor KiwiCo helps kids get a head start there, with a range of unique crates on a myriad of STEM topics,

123
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
covering science, technology, engineering, arts and maths.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Every crate is like a little adventure in a box.

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Imagine the excitement of a trip to the museum or an amazing theme park,

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
but delivered to your doorstep with everything you need neatly packed inside.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There are different lines designed for kids of all ages and interests, so there's something for everyone.

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like us, KiwiCo spends a ridiculous amount of time on fine-tuning each crate.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Every one of their 2,000 available projects took more than 1,000 hours to develop by experts and is tested by kids.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We really liked the KiwiCo Tinker Crate line, which gives you a hands-on engineering project

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
with all of the educational and instructional information you need to complete the project at home.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We might also have decided to just keep some of them around the office and not hand the extras to any kids we know.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
