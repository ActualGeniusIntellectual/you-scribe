00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The universe today is happy and healthy, with exciting things going on.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
But at some point, the night will turn dark.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Everything that once was will peacefully sleep forever.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
But what is the last thing that will ever happen, and when will it be?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
It turns out there is such a thing, and you probably haven't heard about it.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Let's travel to the end of the universe and look at the last thing.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
After a messy birth, our universe was a sleepy baby, warm and dark, filled with swirling clouds of hot hydrogen and helium.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
The story of creation is a story of this gas and where it will end up.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Shortly after, the universe got busy making the first generation of stars.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
They were massive and lived violent lives, forging new elements, only to release most of them when they blew up.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Countless stars were born and refined the gas available in the universe, cycling matter around,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
each generation giving most of its gas and fresh elements to the next.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
But not all gas is returned.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
Every time a new generation of stars forms, they also make more and more red dwarfs that burn slowly and live for trillions of years.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
When they die, they don't give their gas back to the universe, but turn into white dwarfs.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
So red dwarfs lock up more gas forever.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
So more gas is locked forever in other remains of dead stars, neutron stars and black holes,

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
which is bad as it reduces the material available for new stars.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Today, the universe is a great home for us and will remain so for billions of years.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
But most of the gas has been used up or trapped.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Over 90% of the stars that will ever be born have been born already.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
To get to the last thing to ever happen, all other things need to happen first.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
The next few hundred billion years will be fun and a great time for galactic exploration.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
But step by step, large stars and stars like our Sun will die out.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Eventually, almost all the stars will be red dwarfs slowly dying.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
The end of everything, but not quite.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
In a few trillion years, the cosmic gas will finally have run out.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
About 88% of the mass of every galaxy will be white dwarfs, 2% neutron stars and black holes,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
and about 10% gas giants and sad brown dwarf losers.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
White dwarfs are the corpses of old stars, not much bigger than Earth,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
but on average as massive as half our Sun, some even much more.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
This makes them the third densest objects in the universe, after neutron stars and black holes.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
About a million times denser than the Sun today.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Since they used to be active stars, their surface can be as hot as 150,000 degrees.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
White dwarfs are dim, hot, dense spheres that don't do anything anymore.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
But eventually, even white dwarfs will die because they're slowly losing their heat.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
It takes at least 10 trillion years, more than 700 times longer than the current age of the universe.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
As they do their cooling down, the universe around them will irreversibly grow dark,

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
as more and more white dwarfs burn out and turn into dead husks, black dwarfs.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
Spheres of death, as cold as space itself, invisible against the dark backdrop.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Over trillions and trillions of years, every object in every galaxy is eventually either ejected into the void,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
or its orbit decays and it will fall into the central black hole and be destroyed.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
In about a quintillion years, all galaxies have evaporated and every object is on its own,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
in the center of its own observable universe, emptiness as far as can be seen in any direction,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
traveling through black nothingness.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Still, there are things that will happen.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Black holes are dying, slowly.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
They'll fizzle away by emitting Hawking radiation until they're so small that they die in a final flash of light.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
This will take about a googol years, 10 to the power of 100 years, until the last supermassive black hole dies.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
A number so absurd, there's nothing to compare it to.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
Maybe some living beings could have survived around black holes, but even this science fiction option ends now.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
After this unsettling amount of time, we're not even close to the end.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Now is the time of the black dwarfs.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
It turns out there's some weird physics going on inside the dead husk of stars.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
The weird physics of black dwarfs.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
A black dwarf is a sphere the size of Earth, as massive as a star, but almost as cold as absolute zero.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
Stars stay alive because of their intense heat in their cores, so why do black dwarfs not collapse into a black hole?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
What keeps them together?

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
Deep inside a black dwarf, matter is squeezed to densities millions of times greater than anything we see on Earth.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
The pressure is so great that electrons can't combine with nuclei to form atoms.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Instead, matter is weird, degenerate.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
The nuclei are compressed by the weight of the star, locked into a rigid lattice, while the electrons form a plasma between them.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
And these electrons hold the star together.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
We're simplifying, but imagine matter as a subway train and electrons as passengers.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
If there are empty seats, passengers spread out because they care a lot about their personal space.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
But as a black dwarf is so incredibly dense, this is like squishing more and more passengers into our train.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Gravity is pushing in, trying to collapse it.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
The passengers are forced to sit and stand close together, which they hate.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
And so the passengers, our electrons, try to push out against gravity as hard as they can.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
This way the electrons that are having a horrible time in the crowded train that's the black dwarf hold up the star.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
Everything else in the universe may have crumbled already, but these tiny particles push against each other until the end of time.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Or they would, if quantum mechanics didn't ruin everything.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
Simplifying a lot, when particles get close enough, sometimes they can jump at each other and fuse together.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
A process called quantum tunneling.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
This happens constantly in stars because of their intense heat.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
It's one of the key reasons stars can fuse elements into new ones.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
But it also happens at a temperature near absolute zero.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Just, well, mind-numbingly slowly.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
This is the final step to creating the last interesting thing to ever happen in our universe.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Here, in this lone black dwarf, something fantastic occurs.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Nothing happens for a trillion years.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Nothing at all.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Can you imagine that?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But then, a single fusion reaction.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Two carbon nuclei combine by quantum tunneling to become magnesium.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Another 100 trillion years pass.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
It happens again.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Then nothing for another bazillion years.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, two oxygen nuclei combine into silicon.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
As eons pass, the nuclei in the frozen black dwarf slowly combine, making new heavier nuclei.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
And these take even longer to fuse, but given enough time, they eventually will.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Remember the breathtaking amount of time it took for a supermassive black hole to evaporate?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
That's a brief moment in comparison to what's going on here.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
The difference between a second and trillions of years has lost all meaning.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Over a time so absurd that it has no name, nuclei keep fusing into heavier elements.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Until, when silicon nuclei fuse, they form nickel-56.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Nickel-56 is radioactive, which means it's unstable.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
And when it eventually decays and turns into iron, it emits two positrons, antimatter electrons.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
And these two positrons find two electrons and annihilate them and themselves.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Which is a problem?

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Remember how the uncomfortable electrons produce the pressure to hold the star together?

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Destroying the electron means fewer friends to help them hold up the star.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Losing an electron does not give them more space to scratch their butts,

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
it just makes gravity squeeze harder, the walls closing in on those that remain.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
In the case of the most massive black dwarfs, this is catastrophic.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
Bit by bit, the black dwarf turns into a sphere of iron and more electrons are annihilated.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
For at least 10 to the power of 1000 years, almost, but not quite forever,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
there's no visible change in the entire universe.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
And then, finally, the last thing to ever happen, happens.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
The black dwarf has lost one too many electrons.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
It can no longer support its immense mass and goes into an uncontrolled collapse, a supernova.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
It first implodes and then explodes as bright as a galaxy and fills the empty universe with light again.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
A beautiful moment nobody will get to enjoy.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
And then, as quickly as it began, it's all over. Darkness again. Emptiness.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
That was the last thing that will ever happen.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
The universe may now be truly dead, but don't be bummed out about it.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
This is so far away in the future that forever hardly describes it.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Today, the universe is the best place it could be for us.

09:14.000 --> 09:23.000
And you can sleep tight tonight, knowing the last interesting thing that will ever happen is forever long away.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
For now, there are still plenty of interesting things to discover.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And the younger you start discovering, the more you'll understand about the world we live in.

09:35.000 --> 09:42.000
Our sponsor KiwiCo helps kids get a head start there, with a range of unique crates on a myriad of STEM topics,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
covering science, technology, engineering, arts and maths.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Every crate is like a little adventure in a box.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Imagine the excitement of a trip to the museum or an amazing theme park,

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
but delivered to your doorstep with everything you need neatly packed inside.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
There are different lines designed for kids of all ages and interests, so there's something for everyone.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Like us, KiwiCo spends a ridiculous amount of time on fine-tuning each crate.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
Every one of their 2,000 available projects took more than 1,000 hours to develop by experts and is tested by kids.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
We really liked the KiwiCo Tinker Crate line, which gives you a hands-on engineering project

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
with all of the educational and instructional information you need to complete the project at home.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
We might also have decided to just keep some of them around the office and not hand the extras to any kids we know.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
