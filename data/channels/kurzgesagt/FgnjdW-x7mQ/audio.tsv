0	6000	The universe today is happy and healthy, with exciting things going on.
6000	10000	But at some point, the night will turn dark.
10000	15000	Everything that once was will peacefully sleep forever.
15000	20000	But what is the last thing that will ever happen, and when will it be?
20000	25000	It turns out there is such a thing, and you probably haven't heard about it.
25000	31000	Let's travel to the end of the universe and look at the last thing.
31000	39000	After a messy birth, our universe was a sleepy baby, warm and dark, filled with swirling clouds of hot hydrogen and helium.
39000	44000	The story of creation is a story of this gas and where it will end up.
44000	49000	Shortly after, the universe got busy making the first generation of stars.
49000	55000	They were massive and lived violent lives, forging new elements, only to release most of them when they blew up.
55000	61000	Countless stars were born and refined the gas available in the universe, cycling matter around,
61000	65000	each generation giving most of its gas and fresh elements to the next.
65000	67000	But not all gas is returned.
67000	76000	Every time a new generation of stars forms, they also make more and more red dwarfs that burn slowly and live for trillions of years.
76000	81000	When they die, they don't give their gas back to the universe, but turn into white dwarfs.
81000	84000	So red dwarfs lock up more gas forever.
84000	90000	So more gas is locked forever in other remains of dead stars, neutron stars and black holes,
90000	94000	which is bad as it reduces the material available for new stars.
94000	100000	Today, the universe is a great home for us and will remain so for billions of years.
100000	103000	But most of the gas has been used up or trapped.
103000	107000	Over 90% of the stars that will ever be born have been born already.
107000	112000	To get to the last thing to ever happen, all other things need to happen first.
112000	117000	The next few hundred billion years will be fun and a great time for galactic exploration.
117000	123000	But step by step, large stars and stars like our Sun will die out.
123000	127000	Eventually, almost all the stars will be red dwarfs slowly dying.
127000	131000	The end of everything, but not quite.
131000	135000	In a few trillion years, the cosmic gas will finally have run out.
135000	142000	About 88% of the mass of every galaxy will be white dwarfs, 2% neutron stars and black holes,
142000	146000	and about 10% gas giants and sad brown dwarf losers.
146000	150000	White dwarfs are the corpses of old stars, not much bigger than Earth,
150000	155000	but on average as massive as half our Sun, some even much more.
155000	160000	This makes them the third densest objects in the universe, after neutron stars and black holes.
160000	163000	About a million times denser than the Sun today.
163000	169000	Since they used to be active stars, their surface can be as hot as 150,000 degrees.
169000	175000	White dwarfs are dim, hot, dense spheres that don't do anything anymore.
175000	180000	But eventually, even white dwarfs will die because they're slowly losing their heat.
180000	186000	It takes at least 10 trillion years, more than 700 times longer than the current age of the universe.
187000	192000	As they do their cooling down, the universe around them will irreversibly grow dark,
192000	197000	as more and more white dwarfs burn out and turn into dead husks, black dwarfs.
197000	203000	Spheres of death, as cold as space itself, invisible against the dark backdrop.
203000	209000	Over trillions and trillions of years, every object in every galaxy is eventually either ejected into the void,
209000	214000	or its orbit decays and it will fall into the central black hole and be destroyed.
214000	220000	In about a quintillion years, all galaxies have evaporated and every object is on its own,
220000	225000	in the center of its own observable universe, emptiness as far as can be seen in any direction,
225000	227000	traveling through black nothingness.
227000	230000	Still, there are things that will happen.
230000	233000	Black holes are dying, slowly.
233000	240000	They'll fizzle away by emitting Hawking radiation until they're so small that they die in a final flash of light.
240000	247000	This will take about a googol years, 10 to the power of 100 years, until the last supermassive black hole dies.
247000	250000	A number so absurd, there's nothing to compare it to.
250000	257000	Maybe some living beings could have survived around black holes, but even this science fiction option ends now.
257000	261000	After this unsettling amount of time, we're not even close to the end.
261000	264000	Now is the time of the black dwarfs.
264000	269000	It turns out there's some weird physics going on inside the dead husk of stars.
269000	272000	The weird physics of black dwarfs.
272000	279000	A black dwarf is a sphere the size of Earth, as massive as a star, but almost as cold as absolute zero.
279000	286000	Stars stay alive because of their intense heat in their cores, so why do black dwarfs not collapse into a black hole?
286000	288000	What keeps them together?
288000	294000	Deep inside a black dwarf, matter is squeezed to densities millions of times greater than anything we see on Earth.
294000	299000	The pressure is so great that electrons can't combine with nuclei to form atoms.
299000	302000	Instead, matter is weird, degenerate.
302000	310000	The nuclei are compressed by the weight of the star, locked into a rigid lattice, while the electrons form a plasma between them.
310000	313000	And these electrons hold the star together.
313000	318000	We're simplifying, but imagine matter as a subway train and electrons as passengers.
318000	323000	If there are empty seats, passengers spread out because they care a lot about their personal space.
323000	329000	But as a black dwarf is so incredibly dense, this is like squishing more and more passengers into our train.
329000	332000	Gravity is pushing in, trying to collapse it.
332000	336000	The passengers are forced to sit and stand close together, which they hate.
336000	341000	And so the passengers, our electrons, try to push out against gravity as hard as they can.
341000	347000	This way the electrons that are having a horrible time in the crowded train that's the black dwarf hold up the star.
347000	354000	Everything else in the universe may have crumbled already, but these tiny particles push against each other until the end of time.
354000	358000	Or they would, if quantum mechanics didn't ruin everything.
358000	365000	Simplifying a lot, when particles get close enough, sometimes they can jump at each other and fuse together.
365000	367000	A process called quantum tunneling.
367000	371000	This happens constantly in stars because of their intense heat.
371000	375000	It's one of the key reasons stars can fuse elements into new ones.
375000	378000	But it also happens at a temperature near absolute zero.
378000	381000	Just, well, mind-numbingly slowly.
381000	387000	This is the final step to creating the last interesting thing to ever happen in our universe.
387000	392000	Here, in this lone black dwarf, something fantastic occurs.
392000	394000	Nothing happens for a trillion years.
394000	396000	Nothing at all.
396000	397000	Can you imagine that?
398000	401000	But then, a single fusion reaction.
401000	406000	Two carbon nuclei combine by quantum tunneling to become magnesium.
406000	408000	Another 100 trillion years pass.
408000	410000	It happens again.
410000	413000	Then nothing for another bazillion years.
413000	416000	Oh, two oxygen nuclei combine into silicon.
416000	424000	As eons pass, the nuclei in the frozen black dwarf slowly combine, making new heavier nuclei.
424000	429000	And these take even longer to fuse, but given enough time, they eventually will.
429000	434000	Remember the breathtaking amount of time it took for a supermassive black hole to evaporate?
434000	437000	That's a brief moment in comparison to what's going on here.
437000	442000	The difference between a second and trillions of years has lost all meaning.
442000	447000	Over a time so absurd that it has no name, nuclei keep fusing into heavier elements.
447000	452000	Until, when silicon nuclei fuse, they form nickel-56.
452000	456000	Nickel-56 is radioactive, which means it's unstable.
456000	462000	And when it eventually decays and turns into iron, it emits two positrons, antimatter electrons.
462000	467000	And these two positrons find two electrons and annihilate them and themselves.
467000	469000	Which is a problem?
469000	473000	Remember how the uncomfortable electrons produce the pressure to hold the star together?
473000	477000	Destroying the electron means fewer friends to help them hold up the star.
477000	481000	Losing an electron does not give them more space to scratch their butts,
481000	485000	it just makes gravity squeeze harder, the walls closing in on those that remain.
485000	489000	In the case of the most massive black dwarfs, this is catastrophic.
489000	495000	Bit by bit, the black dwarf turns into a sphere of iron and more electrons are annihilated.
495000	500000	For at least 10 to the power of 1000 years, almost, but not quite forever,
500000	503000	there's no visible change in the entire universe.
504000	509000	And then, finally, the last thing to ever happen, happens.
509000	512000	The black dwarf has lost one too many electrons.
512000	518000	It can no longer support its immense mass and goes into an uncontrolled collapse, a supernova.
518000	525000	It first implodes and then explodes as bright as a galaxy and fills the empty universe with light again.
525000	529000	A beautiful moment nobody will get to enjoy.
529000	535000	And then, as quickly as it began, it's all over. Darkness again. Emptiness.
537000	540000	That was the last thing that will ever happen.
540000	545000	The universe may now be truly dead, but don't be bummed out about it.
545000	550000	This is so far away in the future that forever hardly describes it.
550000	554000	Today, the universe is the best place it could be for us.
554000	563000	And you can sleep tight tonight, knowing the last interesting thing that will ever happen is forever long away.
568000	571000	For now, there are still plenty of interesting things to discover.
571000	575000	And the younger you start discovering, the more you'll understand about the world we live in.
575000	582000	Our sponsor KiwiCo helps kids get a head start there, with a range of unique crates on a myriad of STEM topics,
582000	585000	covering science, technology, engineering, arts and maths.
585000	588000	Every crate is like a little adventure in a box.
588000	591000	Imagine the excitement of a trip to the museum or an amazing theme park,
591000	595000	but delivered to your doorstep with everything you need neatly packed inside.
595000	600000	There are different lines designed for kids of all ages and interests, so there's something for everyone.
600000	605000	Like us, KiwiCo spends a ridiculous amount of time on fine-tuning each crate.
605000	612000	Every one of their 2,000 available projects took more than 1,000 hours to develop by experts and is tested by kids.
612000	617000	We really liked the KiwiCo Tinker Crate line, which gives you a hands-on engineering project
617000	622000	with all of the educational and instructional information you need to complete the project at home.
622000	628000	We might also have decided to just keep some of them around the office and not hand the extras to any kids we know.
628000	632000	If you want to try out KiwiCo and get the best deal, click on the link in the info box
632000	636000	or use the code kurzgesagt to get 50% off your first month.
