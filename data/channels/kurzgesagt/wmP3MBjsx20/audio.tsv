720	5840	Mr. President, nuclear missiles will strike our country in 14 minutes.
5840	8880	I know it's your first day in office, I'm going to walk you through it,
8880	12880	but you're the only one who can authorize our nuclear retaliation in response,
12880	15840	and you've only got a few minutes to make a decision.
15840	19440	As you know, tensions have escalated rapidly in the past few days.
19440	24000	Today's Joint Allied Aerial Defense Exercise began just minutes before we detected the launch.
24000	25680	A simple misunderstanding, maybe.
26240	31040	We assume the sudden attack is meant to neutralize as many of our nuclear forces as possible.
31040	34640	But that doesn't matter now, missiles are in the air, and we can't shoot all of them down.
35200	40800	Why? Because intercontinental ballistic missiles are basically rockets launched into space
40800	46080	before reentering the atmosphere over their target and releasing many different warheads,
46080	49120	higher and faster than anything you can send after them.
49120	50960	We need to get you to the bunker.
50960	56880	Here's what we know.
56880	62000	Four minutes ago, our new infrared monitoring satellites detected 112 bursts
62000	65520	consistent with ICBM launches from the enemy's inner territories.
65520	70000	For some reason, only 20 of their 80 underground nuclear silos seemed to have fired,
70000	73360	so we suspect most of them were transporter erector launchers.
73360	75760	You know, trucks with big missiles on them.
75760	78560	It's unclear why they didn't use all their silos.
78560	83040	They might just not work after more than 30 years, or they might be keeping them in reserve.
83040	85840	The fog of war is keeping many things unclear.
85840	91280	Aerospace Command thinks the ICBMs are targeting our nuclear command centers, silos,
91280	95920	and major air force and navy bases, ending this war before we have a chance to act.
96480	101600	The enemy's strategic doctrine prioritizes military targets and our nuclear weapon systems,
101600	105360	but their secondary targets are our industry and infrastructure,
105360	108720	all refineries, power stations, and deep-water ports,
108720	112400	all located near or in major population centers.
113360	116080	We won't know the exact casualty count for a few weeks.
116720	119600	Deaths from the blast and burns may be a few million today.
119600	123920	It's morning rush hour, and there's not much to be done for people stuck in traffic.
123920	126480	People in major metro areas can't really evacuate,
126480	130640	but emergency broadcasts are being sent out to shelter in place and away from windows.
131200	133840	Radiation exposure for intact population centers
133840	136480	is highly dependent on the weather over the next week.
136480	139680	We might be looking at dozens of millions of deaths by the end of the month.
140240	145360	For the next few minutes, we can still respond, but you need to decide.
146080	149760	We've got 1,500 warheads across our silos, bombers, and submarines.
149760	153280	The 400 in silos need to be launched now before they get taken out.
153920	158800	46 nuclear-capable bombers on high alert can be ready to take off in two minutes,
158800	162160	though we need to transmit the order right away to get them out of the blast radius
162160	163840	if you want to consider using them.
163840	167040	Of our 40 nuclear submarines, five are presently at sea.
167040	169200	While they're submerged, they're undetectable,
169200	173600	so that's our backup for a nuclear retaliation if we lose our silos and bombers.
173600	178160	We could try to use them to bomb out their remaining silo fields before they can launch them.
178160	179600	The sooner you commit to it,
179600	183840	the better the chance we have of preventing a further exchange after our retaliation.
184800	185840	Updates
185840	190080	We have radar confirmation that the enemy ICBMs have completed their burn
190080	191600	and deployed their warheads.
192160	196080	Our best guess is that each missile will deploy at least six re-entry vehicles,
196080	200560	about 600 in total, which is the part that carries a warhead back into the atmosphere
200560	205120	during its terminal descent onto the target, and with many more decoys on top of that,
205120	207840	inflatable balloons meant to waste any anti-missiles.
208400	211600	We're now tracking nearly 4,000 potential targets.
212160	217040	Our anti-ballistic missiles have been launched and we'll begin their intercept in another minute.
217040	221040	We'll do our best to protect the capital, although there really is no defense.
222240	227600	Wait! Confirming a partial radar blackout, our systems seem to be glitchy.
227600	230480	The enemy must have anticipated we'd launch our interceptors
230480	233280	and predetonated a few warheads at high altitude.
233280	236560	That ionizes the atmosphere and creates radar interference.
236560	238480	Our interceptors should still operate okay.
238480	240960	They've had a 55% success rate in tests,
240960	244880	but never with this many decoys or with radar interference this intense.
244880	248320	We might shoot down 50 objects, but there's no guarantee their warheads.
248880	250880	It looks like most bombs are going to get through.
252000	255280	This is our last chance to counter-attack. We're out of time.
255280	257440	Our silent launch sequence takes five minutes.
257440	259600	We have to transmit and confirm a launch order,
259600	262720	and the missile needs time to clear the blast radius of the incoming bomb.
263520	266080	This is a lot to take in, but the war plan is made.
266080	268560	You just need to enter the launch authorization codes
268560	270880	and push this button to transmit them.
270880	273520	You can't do anything else to save more of our people.
273520	277360	If you don't launch now, then this war will be over before it even begins.
277360	280240	You understand this is our one chance, right?
281600	282240	The effect?
282880	287040	Enemy civilian casualties are hard to estimate, but should be similar to ours.
287040	290720	A few million right away, perhaps a few tens of million by the end of the month.
291600	295520	The total fallout from their attacks and ours might trigger a nuclear winter,
295520	297760	potentially killing billions around the world.
297760	299840	But that might happen even if we don't retaliate.
300640	305120	I'm sure you have questions, but you have to give orders without expecting answers right now.
305120	308800	With an attack of this scale, there's no guarantee communications or assets
308800	310800	will be intact in a few minutes.
310800	312080	We're out of time.
312080	313440	We need a decision, sir.
314320	316400	Can we launch?
320320	322640	Nuclear wars aren't regular wars.
322640	327840	They only last minutes, and in times of crisis, small conflicts can rapidly spiral out of control.
328400	333120	Anything from small communication lags to sensor errors to just uncertainty in the fog of war
333120	337920	mean that no leader will ever have a complete idea of what's happening as a crisis unfolds.
337920	341920	When tensions are high, accidents or misunderstandings can steer leaders,
341920	344960	even those with good intentions, to launch a nuclear attack.
345840	349440	Confused and with incomplete information, a single person,
349440	352880	yes, it's really just one single person who decides,
352880	355600	can literally make civilization-ending decisions,
355600	359440	killing hundreds of millions of people in the time it takes to watch a YouTube video.
360160	364080	This story is fiction, but the world came very close to this several times.
364720	368560	In 1995, Russian radar detected a submarine-launched missile,
368560	370960	and their nuclear forces went on full alert,
370960	374080	except it was actually a scientific rocket to study auroras.
374640	380400	In 1979, US computers reported a full-scale Soviet attack with only minutes to respond,
380400	383760	except it was a training tape being incorrectly loaded into a computer.
384400	389920	In 1983, the Soviet satellite alert system showed five ICBMs launched from the US,
389920	393440	but it was a false alarm caused by sunlight reflected on clouds.
394080	399040	During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine with no contact to Moscow for several days
399040	403600	concluded that nuclear war had begun and decided to launch a nuclear torpedo.
403600	406480	Luckily, the authorization of three officers was required.
407120	409760	One of them, Vasily Ashhipov, opposed it.
410320	412160	But what if he hadn't?
412160	415440	Any safeguard can fail, no matter how carefully designed it might be.
416320	420480	And decisions are being made right now to build new weapons and missile systems
420480	423440	that commit the world to another century of nuclear stalemate,
423440	426800	complicated further by China's emergence as a new nuclear superpower.
427760	431520	Simply accepting that the existence of nuclear weapons is inevitable
431520	433680	might mean their use is inevitable.
434480	436160	But the world doesn't have to be this way.
436800	439760	Even incremental steps taking apart one bomb at a time
439760	442000	will eventually result in a world with none.
442800	446960	During the Cold War, the world had over 70,000 nuclear weapons.
446960	451200	Through arms reduction treaties, that number is now about 12,500.
451920	455600	Progress is not guaranteed, but it's also not impossible.
456480	459760	Governments and militaries are not separate from their nations,
459760	461360	they're part of them, just like you.
462080	464320	You have the power to make demands of your leaders,
464320	466960	and often this begins with just being aware of an issue.
467520	470560	If you want to learn more, we've compiled a number of resources for you
470560	472640	in the video description and our sources.
474000	476640	This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.
476640	479200	Did you know that there are countless more Kurzgesagt videos
479200	482800	that we upload on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels?
482800	486560	Bite-sized information, animated facts, and inspiring thought experiments.
486560	489680	After all, you also need videos you can watch quickly in a bathroom break,
489840	492960	and our longer, more in-depth videos are happening here on YouTube.
492960	494720	Short form is a completely different challenge
