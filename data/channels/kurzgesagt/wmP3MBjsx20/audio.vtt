00:00.720 --> 00:05.840
Mr. President, nuclear missiles will strike our country in 14 minutes.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.880
I know it's your first day in office, I'm going to walk you through it,

00:08.880 --> 00:12.880
but you're the only one who can authorize our nuclear retaliation in response,

00:12.880 --> 00:15.840
and you've only got a few minutes to make a decision.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.440
As you know, tensions have escalated rapidly in the past few days.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.000
Today's Joint Allied Aerial Defense Exercise began just minutes before we detected the launch.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.680
A simple misunderstanding, maybe.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.040
We assume the sudden attack is meant to neutralize as many of our nuclear forces as possible.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.640
But that doesn't matter now, missiles are in the air, and we can't shoot all of them down.

00:35.200 --> 00:40.800
Why? Because intercontinental ballistic missiles are basically rockets launched into space

00:40.800 --> 00:46.080
before reentering the atmosphere over their target and releasing many different warheads,

00:46.080 --> 00:49.120
higher and faster than anything you can send after them.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.960
We need to get you to the bunker.

00:50.960 --> 00:56.880
Here's what we know.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.000
Four minutes ago, our new infrared monitoring satellites detected 112 bursts

01:02.000 --> 01:05.520
consistent with ICBM launches from the enemy's inner territories.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.000
For some reason, only 20 of their 80 underground nuclear silos seemed to have fired,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.360
so we suspect most of them were transporter erector launchers.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.760
You know, trucks with big missiles on them.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.560
It's unclear why they didn't use all their silos.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.040
They might just not work after more than 30 years, or they might be keeping them in reserve.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.840
The fog of war is keeping many things unclear.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.280
Aerospace Command thinks the ICBMs are targeting our nuclear command centers, silos,

01:31.280 --> 01:35.920
and major air force and navy bases, ending this war before we have a chance to act.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.600
The enemy's strategic doctrine prioritizes military targets and our nuclear weapon systems,

01:41.600 --> 01:45.360
but their secondary targets are our industry and infrastructure,

01:45.360 --> 01:48.720
all refineries, power stations, and deep-water ports,

01:48.720 --> 01:52.400
all located near or in major population centers.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.080
We won't know the exact casualty count for a few weeks.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.600
Deaths from the blast and burns may be a few million today.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.920
It's morning rush hour, and there's not much to be done for people stuck in traffic.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.480
People in major metro areas can't really evacuate,

02:06.480 --> 02:10.640
but emergency broadcasts are being sent out to shelter in place and away from windows.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.840
Radiation exposure for intact population centers

02:13.840 --> 02:16.480
is highly dependent on the weather over the next week.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.680
We might be looking at dozens of millions of deaths by the end of the month.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.360
For the next few minutes, we can still respond, but you need to decide.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.760
We've got 1,500 warheads across our silos, bombers, and submarines.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.280
The 400 in silos need to be launched now before they get taken out.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.800
46 nuclear-capable bombers on high alert can be ready to take off in two minutes,

02:38.800 --> 02:42.160
though we need to transmit the order right away to get them out of the blast radius

02:42.160 --> 02:43.840
if you want to consider using them.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.040
Of our 40 nuclear submarines, five are presently at sea.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.200
While they're submerged, they're undetectable,

02:49.200 --> 02:53.600
so that's our backup for a nuclear retaliation if we lose our silos and bombers.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.160
We could try to use them to bomb out their remaining silo fields before they can launch them.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.600
The sooner you commit to it,

02:59.600 --> 03:03.840
the better the chance we have of preventing a further exchange after our retaliation.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.840
Updates

03:05.840 --> 03:10.080
We have radar confirmation that the enemy ICBMs have completed their burn

03:10.080 --> 03:11.600
and deployed their warheads.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.080
Our best guess is that each missile will deploy at least six re-entry vehicles,

03:16.080 --> 03:20.560
about 600 in total, which is the part that carries a warhead back into the atmosphere

03:20.560 --> 03:25.120
during its terminal descent onto the target, and with many more decoys on top of that,

03:25.120 --> 03:27.840
inflatable balloons meant to waste any anti-missiles.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.600
We're now tracking nearly 4,000 potential targets.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.040
Our anti-ballistic missiles have been launched and we'll begin their intercept in another minute.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.040
We'll do our best to protect the capital, although there really is no defense.

03:42.240 --> 03:47.600
Wait! Confirming a partial radar blackout, our systems seem to be glitchy.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.480
The enemy must have anticipated we'd launch our interceptors

03:50.480 --> 03:53.280
and predetonated a few warheads at high altitude.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.560
That ionizes the atmosphere and creates radar interference.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.480
Our interceptors should still operate okay.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.960
They've had a 55% success rate in tests,

04:00.960 --> 04:04.880
but never with this many decoys or with radar interference this intense.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.320
We might shoot down 50 objects, but there's no guarantee their warheads.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.880
It looks like most bombs are going to get through.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.280
This is our last chance to counter-attack. We're out of time.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.440
Our silent launch sequence takes five minutes.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.600
We have to transmit and confirm a launch order,

04:19.600 --> 04:22.720
and the missile needs time to clear the blast radius of the incoming bomb.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.080
This is a lot to take in, but the war plan is made.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.560
You just need to enter the launch authorization codes

04:28.560 --> 04:30.880
and push this button to transmit them.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.520
You can't do anything else to save more of our people.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.360
If you don't launch now, then this war will be over before it even begins.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.240
You understand this is our one chance, right?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.240
The effect?

04:42.880 --> 04:47.040
Enemy civilian casualties are hard to estimate, but should be similar to ours.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.720
A few million right away, perhaps a few tens of million by the end of the month.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.520
The total fallout from their attacks and ours might trigger a nuclear winter,

04:55.520 --> 04:57.760
potentially killing billions around the world.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.840
But that might happen even if we don't retaliate.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.120
I'm sure you have questions, but you have to give orders without expecting answers right now.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.800
With an attack of this scale, there's no guarantee communications or assets

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
will be intact in a few minutes.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.080
We're out of time.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.440
We need a decision, sir.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.400
Can we launch?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.640
Nuclear wars aren't regular wars.

05:22.640 --> 05:27.840
They only last minutes, and in times of crisis, small conflicts can rapidly spiral out of control.

05:28.400 --> 05:33.120
Anything from small communication lags to sensor errors to just uncertainty in the fog of war

05:33.120 --> 05:37.920
mean that no leader will ever have a complete idea of what's happening as a crisis unfolds.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.920
When tensions are high, accidents or misunderstandings can steer leaders,

05:41.920 --> 05:44.960
even those with good intentions, to launch a nuclear attack.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.440
Confused and with incomplete information, a single person,

05:49.440 --> 05:52.880
yes, it's really just one single person who decides,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.600
can literally make civilization-ending decisions,

05:55.600 --> 05:59.440
killing hundreds of millions of people in the time it takes to watch a YouTube video.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.080
This story is fiction, but the world came very close to this several times.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.560
In 1995, Russian radar detected a submarine-launched missile,

06:08.560 --> 06:10.960
and their nuclear forces went on full alert,

06:10.960 --> 06:14.080
except it was actually a scientific rocket to study auroras.

06:14.640 --> 06:20.400
In 1979, US computers reported a full-scale Soviet attack with only minutes to respond,

06:20.400 --> 06:23.760
except it was a training tape being incorrectly loaded into a computer.

06:24.400 --> 06:29.920
In 1983, the Soviet satellite alert system showed five ICBMs launched from the US,

06:29.920 --> 06:33.440
but it was a false alarm caused by sunlight reflected on clouds.

06:34.080 --> 06:39.040
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine with no contact to Moscow for several days

06:39.040 --> 06:43.600
concluded that nuclear war had begun and decided to launch a nuclear torpedo.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.480
Luckily, the authorization of three officers was required.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.760
One of them, Vasily Ashhipov, opposed it.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.160
But what if he hadn't?

06:52.160 --> 06:55.440
Any safeguard can fail, no matter how carefully designed it might be.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.480
And decisions are being made right now to build new weapons and missile systems

07:00.480 --> 07:03.440
that commit the world to another century of nuclear stalemate,

07:03.440 --> 07:06.800
complicated further by China's emergence as a new nuclear superpower.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.520
Simply accepting that the existence of nuclear weapons is inevitable

07:11.520 --> 07:13.680
might mean their use is inevitable.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.160
But the world doesn't have to be this way.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.760
Even incremental steps taking apart one bomb at a time

07:19.760 --> 07:22.000
will eventually result in a world with none.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.960
During the Cold War, the world had over 70,000 nuclear weapons.

07:26.960 --> 07:31.200
Through arms reduction treaties, that number is now about 12,500.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.600
Progress is not guaranteed, but it's also not impossible.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.760
Governments and militaries are not separate from their nations,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.360
they're part of them, just like you.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.320
You have the power to make demands of your leaders,

07:44.320 --> 07:46.960
and often this begins with just being aware of an issue.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.560
If you want to learn more, we've compiled a number of resources for you

07:50.560 --> 07:52.640
in the video description and our sources.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.640
This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.200
Did you know that there are countless more Kurzgesagt videos

07:59.200 --> 08:02.800
that we upload on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels?

08:02.800 --> 08:06.560
Bite-sized information, animated facts, and inspiring thought experiments.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.680
After all, you also need videos you can watch quickly in a bathroom break,

08:09.840 --> 08:12.960
and our longer, more in-depth videos are happening here on YouTube.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.720
Short form is a completely different challenge

08:14.720 --> 08:16.480
that we're trying to do as well as possible.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.240
Check them out if you're curious.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.800
And if you want to discuss and share your thoughts about science

08:20.800 --> 08:22.000
with other like-minded people,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.520
why don't you check out our Discord community with over 80,000 burps?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.840
We have channels where you can chat about STEM topics,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.960
participate in events, and the academic question of the week.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.800
And we have the best emotes.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.040
After all, we want to spark your curiosity,

08:35.040 --> 08:37.760
but it's always more fun to be curious together.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.480
See you over there.
