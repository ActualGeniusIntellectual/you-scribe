1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,840
Mr. President, nuclear missiles will strike our country in 14 minutes.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,880
I know it's your first day in office, I'm going to walk you through it,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
but you're the only one who can authorize our nuclear retaliation in response,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,840
and you've only got a few minutes to make a decision.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,440
As you know, tensions have escalated rapidly in the past few days.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,000
Today's Joint Allied Aerial Defense Exercise began just minutes before we detected the launch.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,680
A simple misunderstanding, maybe.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,040
We assume the sudden attack is meant to neutralize as many of our nuclear forces as possible.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,640
But that doesn't matter now, missiles are in the air, and we can't shoot all of them down.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,800
Why? Because intercontinental ballistic missiles are basically rockets launched into space

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,080
before reentering the atmosphere over their target and releasing many different warheads,

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,120
higher and faster than anything you can send after them.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,960
We need to get you to the bunker.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Here's what we know.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,000
Four minutes ago, our new infrared monitoring satellites detected 112 bursts

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,520
consistent with ICBM launches from the enemy's inner territories.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,000
For some reason, only 20 of their 80 underground nuclear silos seemed to have fired,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,360
so we suspect most of them were transporter erector launchers.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,760
You know, trucks with big missiles on them.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,560
It's unclear why they didn't use all their silos.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
They might just not work after more than 30 years, or they might be keeping them in reserve.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,840
The fog of war is keeping many things unclear.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,280
Aerospace Command thinks the ICBMs are targeting our nuclear command centers, silos,

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
and major air force and navy bases, ending this war before we have a chance to act.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,600
The enemy's strategic doctrine prioritizes military targets and our nuclear weapon systems,

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,360
but their secondary targets are our industry and infrastructure,

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
all refineries, power stations, and deep-water ports,

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,400
all located near or in major population centers.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,080
We won't know the exact casualty count for a few weeks.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,600
Deaths from the blast and burns may be a few million today.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,920
It's morning rush hour, and there's not much to be done for people stuck in traffic.

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,480
People in major metro areas can't really evacuate,

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,640
but emergency broadcasts are being sent out to shelter in place and away from windows.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
Radiation exposure for intact population centers

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
is highly dependent on the weather over the next week.

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
We might be looking at dozens of millions of deaths by the end of the month.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,360
For the next few minutes, we can still respond, but you need to decide.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
We've got 1,500 warheads across our silos, bombers, and submarines.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
The 400 in silos need to be launched now before they get taken out.

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,800
46 nuclear-capable bombers on high alert can be ready to take off in two minutes,

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
though we need to transmit the order right away to get them out of the blast radius

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
if you want to consider using them.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
Of our 40 nuclear submarines, five are presently at sea.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
While they're submerged, they're undetectable,

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,600
so that's our backup for a nuclear retaliation if we lose our silos and bombers.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,160
We could try to use them to bomb out their remaining silo fields before they can launch them.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
The sooner you commit to it,

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,840
the better the chance we have of preventing a further exchange after our retaliation.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Updates

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
We have radar confirmation that the enemy ICBMs have completed their burn

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,600
and deployed their warheads.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,080
Our best guess is that each missile will deploy at least six re-entry vehicles,

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
about 600 in total, which is the part that carries a warhead back into the atmosphere

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
during its terminal descent onto the target, and with many more decoys on top of that,

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,840
inflatable balloons meant to waste any anti-missiles.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,600
We're now tracking nearly 4,000 potential targets.

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,040
Our anti-ballistic missiles have been launched and we'll begin their intercept in another minute.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
We'll do our best to protect the capital, although there really is no defense.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,600
Wait! Confirming a partial radar blackout, our systems seem to be glitchy.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,480
The enemy must have anticipated we'd launch our interceptors

61
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
and predetonated a few warheads at high altitude.

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
That ionizes the atmosphere and creates radar interference.

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
Our interceptors should still operate okay.

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,960
They've had a 55% success rate in tests,

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,880
but never with this many decoys or with radar interference this intense.

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,320
We might shoot down 50 objects, but there's no guarantee their warheads.

67
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
It looks like most bombs are going to get through.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
This is our last chance to counter-attack. We're out of time.

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,440
Our silent launch sequence takes five minutes.

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
We have to transmit and confirm a launch order,

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,720
and the missile needs time to clear the blast radius of the incoming bomb.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
This is a lot to take in, but the war plan is made.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
You just need to enter the launch authorization codes

74
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
and push this button to transmit them.

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
You can't do anything else to save more of our people.

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,360
If you don't launch now, then this war will be over before it even begins.

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,240
You understand this is our one chance, right?

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,240
The effect?

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,040
Enemy civilian casualties are hard to estimate, but should be similar to ours.

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
A few million right away, perhaps a few tens of million by the end of the month.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
The total fallout from their attacks and ours might trigger a nuclear winter,

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,760
potentially killing billions around the world.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,840
But that might happen even if we don't retaliate.

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,120
I'm sure you have questions, but you have to give orders without expecting answers right now.

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
With an attack of this scale, there's no guarantee communications or assets

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
will be intact in a few minutes.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
We're out of time.

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
We need a decision, sir.

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
Can we launch?

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,640
Nuclear wars aren't regular wars.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,840
They only last minutes, and in times of crisis, small conflicts can rapidly spiral out of control.

92
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,120
Anything from small communication lags to sensor errors to just uncertainty in the fog of war

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,920
mean that no leader will ever have a complete idea of what's happening as a crisis unfolds.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,920
When tensions are high, accidents or misunderstandings can steer leaders,

95
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,960
even those with good intentions, to launch a nuclear attack.

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
Confused and with incomplete information, a single person,

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,880
yes, it's really just one single person who decides,

98
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
can literally make civilization-ending decisions,

99
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,440
killing hundreds of millions of people in the time it takes to watch a YouTube video.

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080
This story is fiction, but the world came very close to this several times.

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,560
In 1995, Russian radar detected a submarine-launched missile,

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
and their nuclear forces went on full alert,

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
except it was actually a scientific rocket to study auroras.

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,400
In 1979, US computers reported a full-scale Soviet attack with only minutes to respond,

105
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,760
except it was a training tape being incorrectly loaded into a computer.

106
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,920
In 1983, the Soviet satellite alert system showed five ICBMs launched from the US,

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,440
but it was a false alarm caused by sunlight reflected on clouds.

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,040
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine with no contact to Moscow for several days

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,600
concluded that nuclear war had begun and decided to launch a nuclear torpedo.

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,480
Luckily, the authorization of three officers was required.

111
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,760
One of them, Vasily Ashhipov, opposed it.

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,160
But what if he hadn't?

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
Any safeguard can fail, no matter how carefully designed it might be.

114
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,480
And decisions are being made right now to build new weapons and missile systems

115
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,440
that commit the world to another century of nuclear stalemate,

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
complicated further by China's emergence as a new nuclear superpower.

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,520
Simply accepting that the existence of nuclear weapons is inevitable

118
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
might mean their use is inevitable.

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
But the world doesn't have to be this way.

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,760
Even incremental steps taking apart one bomb at a time

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
will eventually result in a world with none.

122
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,960
During the Cold War, the world had over 70,000 nuclear weapons.

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,200
Through arms reduction treaties, that number is now about 12,500.

124
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,600
Progress is not guaranteed, but it's also not impossible.

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,760
Governments and militaries are not separate from their nations,

126
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
they're part of them, just like you.

127
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,320
You have the power to make demands of your leaders,

128
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,960
and often this begins with just being aware of an issue.

129
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
If you want to learn more, we've compiled a number of resources for you

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,640
in the video description and our sources.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,640
This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,200
Did you know that there are countless more Kurzgesagt videos

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,800
that we upload on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels?

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
Bite-sized information, animated facts, and inspiring thought experiments.

135
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
After all, you also need videos you can watch quickly in a bathroom break,

136
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
and our longer, more in-depth videos are happening here on YouTube.

137
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
Short form is a completely different challenge

138
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,480
that we're trying to do as well as possible.

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,240
Check them out if you're curious.

140
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
And if you want to discuss and share your thoughts about science

141
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
with other like-minded people,

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
why don't you check out our Discord community with over 80,000 burps?

143
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
We have channels where you can chat about STEM topics,

144
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
participate in events, and the academic question of the week.

145
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,800
And we have the best emotes.

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,040
After all, we want to spark your curiosity,

147
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,760
but it's always more fun to be curious together.

148
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,480
See you over there.
