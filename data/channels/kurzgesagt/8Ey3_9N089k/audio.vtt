The next atomic bomb is made of DNA, and it's as affordable as a new car.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
In recent years, genetic data has become more available, knowledge more widespread, and lab resources less expensive.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Bioengineering had previously been restricted to well-funded laboratories, where research produced marvels like gene therapy and COVID-19 vaccines.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
But now, it's getting increasingly open to anyone willing to spend a year's salary on lab equipment.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
That includes people who want to do harm, who are poorly trained in safety, or just reckless.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
From terrorist attacks to lab accidents, the effects of a loose engineered virus could be devastating.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
In 1945, the Manhattan Project spawned the threat of nuclear annihilation, while simultaneously providing the key to nuclear power.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Biotech is just as threatening today, and few people are even aware of how powerful it's become, and will become, in the next few years.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
We don't have decades to do something about it. We must act. Now. But how? Watch the full video on our channel to find out.
