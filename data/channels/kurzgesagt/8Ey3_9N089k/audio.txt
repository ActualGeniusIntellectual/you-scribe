The next atomic bomb is made of DNA, and it's as affordable as a new car.
In recent years, genetic data has become more available, knowledge more widespread, and lab resources less expensive.
Bioengineering had previously been restricted to well-funded laboratories, where research produced marvels like gene therapy and COVID-19 vaccines.
But now, it's getting increasingly open to anyone willing to spend a year's salary on lab equipment.
That includes people who want to do harm, who are poorly trained in safety, or just reckless.
From terrorist attacks to lab accidents, the effects of a loose engineered virus could be devastating.
