{"text": " The next atomic bomb is made of DNA, and it's as affordable as a new car. In recent years, genetic data has become more available, knowledge more widespread, and lab resources less expensive. Bioengineering had previously been restricted to well-funded laboratories, where research produced marvels like gene therapy and COVID-19 vaccines. But now, it's getting increasingly open to anyone willing to spend a year's salary on lab equipment. That includes people who want to do harm, who are poorly trained in safety, or just reckless. From terrorist attacks to lab accidents, the effects of a loose engineered virus could be devastating. In 1945, the Manhattan Project spawned the threat of nuclear annihilation, while simultaneously providing the key to nuclear power. Biotech is just as threatening today, and few people are even aware of how powerful it's become, and will become, in the next few years. We don't have decades to do something about it. We must act. Now. But how?
