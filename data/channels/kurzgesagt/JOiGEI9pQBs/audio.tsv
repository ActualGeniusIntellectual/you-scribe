0	5920	The 12,024 calendar is here. Get it now before it sells out, and stay tuned until the end
5920	10680	of this video for a sneak peek that's out of this world.
10680	16700	Life has existed on one planet for about 4 billion years, as far as we know. But it might
16700	22440	have started right after the Big Bang, when the universe was much stranger and more fantastic
22440	29720	than today. A universe that might have allowed life to develop absolutely anywhere. The cosmos
29720	35080	might be full of the seeds of life, sleeping in a dead desert, waiting for a few drops
35080	43780	of rain to explosively bloom and grow. Tiny and not-so-tiny aliens might be everywhere.
43780	48020	In this video, we're going to put together two highly speculative yet scientifically
48020	53360	grounded possibilities. Check out the scientific papers in our sources. To properly explain
53360	57720	this, let's first look at the paradox of life on Earth.
57720	64300	The Life Paradox. For its first few hundred million years, Earth was a magma hell, constantly
64300	69760	bombarded by asteroids. But basically the second things calmed down and the first oceans
69760	75520	formed, life just appeared, and zillions of microbes settled every nook and cranny they
75520	82120	found. This is kind of strange. Life on Earth seems to be almost as old as the planet itself.
82120	87840	As if it was waiting around for an opportunity. But life didn't only appear extremely quickly.
87840	94440	In that tiny time window, it also crossed a huge gap. To qualify as living things, even
94440	100900	microbes need to eat, poop, grow, and multiply. To do that, they need a genome, the biological
100900	106800	instruction manual that sets the inner workings of an organism. How dead things with no genome
106800	112480	become living things with genomes is one of the biggest riddles of science. Simplifying
112480	117760	a lot, the problem is that to have a functioning genome, you need proteins, and to make those
117760	123060	proteins, you need a functioning genome. Both proteins and genomes are super long molecules
123060	128680	made of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult to assemble by chance. It's a chicken
128680	134080	egg paradox with several chickens and eggs. Once you have a finished cell, the whole system
134080	139740	works efficiently. But starting from simple dead stuff and reaching that level of sophistication
139740	146340	by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error. So how did the
146340	152040	first living things manage to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years? Most
152040	157620	theories about the origin of life try to explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive
157620	163800	soup of prebiotic molecules could have efficiently produced the first self-replicating entities.
163800	168480	But we still don't know how exactly this would have worked. Maybe we need to think
168480	177280	backwards. The clock of evolution. Think of genomes as a book telling the history of life.
177280	184520	As time passed and life evolved, more characters were introduced. Amoeba, fish, amphibians,
184520	191360	dinosaurs, and mammals. Over billions of years, the story of life got more and more complex.
191360	195900	A genome can be viewed as a long string of letters with biological instructions. And
195900	201000	from microbes to us today, functional genomes seem to have been increasing in size at a
201000	207440	fairly constant rate. The functional genome of fish is more than twice that of worms.
207440	211800	Our functional genome is about twice bigger than that of fish, and so on. It is a bit
211800	217560	more complicated, but for now, let's run with this. When we put all these clues together,
217560	222800	it seems that genomes have been doubling in size on average every 350 million years
222800	229520	or so. As if evolution had been following an exponential inner clock. But it gets even
229520	236180	stranger. The very first microbes that emerged on Earth, even if they look simple, already
236180	242240	seem to have had pretty long and complex genomes. But how could life have achieved that level
242240	248700	of complexity in such a short time? There may be an interesting way to solve this riddle.
248700	253920	We just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time to the simplest conceivable
253920	260120	life form, something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a few letters.
260120	266880	But if we do that, we end up 10 billion years in the past, more than twice the age of Earth,
266880	273120	which means, if life actually evolved like this, it didn't start here, but somewhere
273120	279080	out there, in space. This would explain why life started to thrive so quickly on our young
279080	284560	planet. If it was already present in space like a sea, it just needed water and warm
284560	289940	temperatures to wake up and go on evolving. And it would also explain the high degree
289940	294880	of sophistication of the first life forms on Earth. They could have been complex already,
294880	299520	because they might have been evolving for billions of years somewhere else in the universe.
299520	306180	But could life really be that old? Maybe, yes. Actually, life could have started shortly
306180	309400	after the universe itself was born.
309400	316740	A Goldilocks Baby Universe. At its most basic level, life needs two things. The right chemical
316740	321720	elements to form complex molecules, and a liquid medium, like water, in which those
321720	327400	molecules can move and interact. The liquid medium needs to stay warm enough to remain,
327400	333200	well, liquid. So when we search for life in space, we focus on Earth-like planets at just
333200	338480	the right distance from their star, warm enough to sustain liquid water. But there was actually
338480	344120	a time when almost all of the universe might have been habitable. Right after the Big Bang,
344120	350440	the universe was extremely hot. But as the cosmos expanded, it cooled. And between about
350440	355400	10 and 17 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was a thousand times younger
355400	363420	than today, it was between 100°C and 0°C, the temperature at which water is liquid.
363420	370040	So for this window of time, more than 13.7 billion years ago, the whole universe, absolutely
370040	375940	every inch of it, had the right temperature to support life. Of course, the right temperature
375940	381340	alone is not enough for life. We also need chemical elements like carbon and oxygen,
381340	386980	which are forged in the cores of stars. But were there stars in super early cosmic times?
386980	393480	Maybe, yes, in regions of the universe where matter was especially dense. Such stars would
393480	398460	have been very massive and gone supernova in just 3 million years, sealing the baby
398460	403340	universe with the chemical elements needed to form dust, asteroids, planets, and the
403340	410220	ingredients of life. Maybe the first ancestors of life were more exotic and didn't even need
410220	415660	water but thrived in substances like ammonia or ethane that can stay liquid at temperatures
415660	421700	far below 0°C. They could have been sustained by the lingering warmth of the Big Bang for
421700	427020	tens of millions of years longer, well into a time when we know for sure there were stars
427020	432580	and all the chemical elements. The real magic of this idea is that while the universe today
432580	437700	is extremely deadly and hostile, back then, the conditions for life might have been basically
437700	443220	everywhere. For a period that may have lasted several dozen million years, primordial life
443220	449200	might have been able to emerge on any rock, even between the stars, sowing the universe with the
449200	456660	seeds of what, billions of years later, would become bacteria, trilobites, dinosaurs, and finally
456660	462620	us. At some point, the universe cooled down below the right temperature for life to thrive,
462620	468380	but some of those ancestral life forms may have continued to exist in the internal warmth of the
468380	475260	first planets, frozen in asteroids or hibernating in cosmic dust, tiny seeds roaming the cosmos,
475260	481820	waiting for new hospitable places to continue evolving. If they did, life now might be
481820	490100	everywhere in the universe. Will we ever know? All this makes for a nice story, and while both
490100	495060	the habitability of the baby universe and our exponential clock of life are reasonable ideas,
495060	501620	they're still speculative, one more possibility among many others trying to explain our existence
501620	507620	today. But if life came to Earth from outer space, then it should have seeded other places in the
507620	514580	solar system too. Maybe there are fossils in dry riverbeds on Mars. Maybe we'll soon find life in
514580	521020	the warm underground oceans of Enceladus or Europa. Titan has seas, rivers, and lakes of
521020	527540	ethane and methane as warm as the universe when it was 90 million years old. So finding exotic
527540	533740	life on Titan would support the idea that life could have originated in the weird baby universe.
533860	540660	So far, when we look out into the cosmos, we don't see anyone like us. But maybe that's because life
540660	545620	needed 10 billion years or more to reach the level of complexity that allows for a technological
545620	551900	species. Maybe there are millions of worlds filled with microbes, oceans full of exotic fish,
551900	558900	and continents of bizarre animals. And maybe even others like us that just recently gained
558940	565820	consciousness and are beginning to look at the sky, wondering if they're alone. Life could be
565820	571620	flourishing right now in uncountable forms, and in all kinds of cosmic environments. And if many
571620	578140	of us share a common cosmic origin, we would all be part of a great cosmic family. The answer may
578140	588660	lie in our cosmic backyard. Let's go and find out. It's time. Let's reveal the 12,024 human
