The 12,024 calendar is here. Get it now before it sells out, and stay tuned until the end

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,680
of this video for a sneak peek that's out of this world.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,700
Life has existed on one planet for about 4 billion years, as far as we know. But it might

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,440
have started right after the Big Bang, when the universe was much stranger and more fantastic

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,720
than today. A universe that might have allowed life to develop absolutely anywhere. The cosmos

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,080
might be full of the seeds of life, sleeping in a dead desert, waiting for a few drops

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:43,780
of rain to explosively bloom and grow. Tiny and not-so-tiny aliens might be everywhere.

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,020
In this video, we're going to put together two highly speculative yet scientifically

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,360
grounded possibilities. Check out the scientific papers in our sources. To properly explain

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,720
this, let's first look at the paradox of life on Earth.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,300
The Life Paradox. For its first few hundred million years, Earth was a magma hell, constantly

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,760
bombarded by asteroids. But basically the second things calmed down and the first oceans

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,520
formed, life just appeared, and zillions of microbes settled every nook and cranny they

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,120
found. This is kind of strange. Life on Earth seems to be almost as old as the planet itself.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,840
As if it was waiting around for an opportunity. But life didn't only appear extremely quickly.

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,440
In that tiny time window, it also crossed a huge gap. To qualify as living things, even

17
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,900
microbes need to eat, poop, grow, and multiply. To do that, they need a genome, the biological

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,800
instruction manual that sets the inner workings of an organism. How dead things with no genome

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,480
become living things with genomes is one of the biggest riddles of science. Simplifying

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,760
a lot, the problem is that to have a functioning genome, you need proteins, and to make those

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,060
proteins, you need a functioning genome. Both proteins and genomes are super long molecules

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,680
made of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult to assemble by chance. It's a chicken

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,080
egg paradox with several chickens and eggs. Once you have a finished cell, the whole system

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,740
works efficiently. But starting from simple dead stuff and reaching that level of sophistication

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,340
by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error. So how did the

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,040
first living things manage to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years? Most

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,620
theories about the origin of life try to explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,800
soup of prebiotic molecules could have efficiently produced the first self-replicating entities.

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,480
But we still don't know how exactly this would have worked. Maybe we need to think

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:57,280
backwards. The clock of evolution. Think of genomes as a book telling the history of life.

31
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,520
As time passed and life evolved, more characters were introduced. Amoeba, fish, amphibians,

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,360
dinosaurs, and mammals. Over billions of years, the story of life got more and more complex.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,900
A genome can be viewed as a long string of letters with biological instructions. And

34
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,000
from microbes to us today, functional genomes seem to have been increasing in size at a

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,440
fairly constant rate. The functional genome of fish is more than twice that of worms.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,800
Our functional genome is about twice bigger than that of fish, and so on. It is a bit

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,560
more complicated, but for now, let's run with this. When we put all these clues together,

38
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,800
it seems that genomes have been doubling in size on average every 350 million years

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,520
or so. As if evolution had been following an exponential inner clock. But it gets even

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,180
stranger. The very first microbes that emerged on Earth, even if they look simple, already

41
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,240
seem to have had pretty long and complex genomes. But how could life have achieved that level

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,700
of complexity in such a short time? There may be an interesting way to solve this riddle.

43
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,920
We just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time to the simplest conceivable

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,120
life form, something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a few letters.

45
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,880
But if we do that, we end up 10 billion years in the past, more than twice the age of Earth,

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,120
which means, if life actually evolved like this, it didn't start here, but somewhere

47
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,080
out there, in space. This would explain why life started to thrive so quickly on our young

48
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,560
planet. If it was already present in space like a sea, it just needed water and warm

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,940
temperatures to wake up and go on evolving. And it would also explain the high degree

50
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,880
of sophistication of the first life forms on Earth. They could have been complex already,

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,520
because they might have been evolving for billions of years somewhere else in the universe.

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,180
But could life really be that old? Maybe, yes. Actually, life could have started shortly

53
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,400
after the universe itself was born.

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,740
A Goldilocks Baby Universe. At its most basic level, life needs two things. The right chemical

55
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,720
elements to form complex molecules, and a liquid medium, like water, in which those

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,400
molecules can move and interact. The liquid medium needs to stay warm enough to remain,

57
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,200
well, liquid. So when we search for life in space, we focus on Earth-like planets at just

58
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,480
the right distance from their star, warm enough to sustain liquid water. But there was actually

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,120
a time when almost all of the universe might have been habitable. Right after the Big Bang,

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,440
the universe was extremely hot. But as the cosmos expanded, it cooled. And between about

61
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,400
10 and 17 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was a thousand times younger

62
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,420
than today, it was between 100°C and 0°C, the temperature at which water is liquid.

63
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,040
So for this window of time, more than 13.7 billion years ago, the whole universe, absolutely

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,940
every inch of it, had the right temperature to support life. Of course, the right temperature

65
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,340
alone is not enough for life. We also need chemical elements like carbon and oxygen,

66
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,980
which are forged in the cores of stars. But were there stars in super early cosmic times?

67
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,480
Maybe, yes, in regions of the universe where matter was especially dense. Such stars would

68
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,460
have been very massive and gone supernova in just 3 million years, sealing the baby

69
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,340
universe with the chemical elements needed to form dust, asteroids, planets, and the

70
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,220
ingredients of life. Maybe the first ancestors of life were more exotic and didn't even need

71
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,660
water but thrived in substances like ammonia or ethane that can stay liquid at temperatures

72
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,700
far below 0°C. They could have been sustained by the lingering warmth of the Big Bang for

73
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,020
tens of millions of years longer, well into a time when we know for sure there were stars

74
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,580
and all the chemical elements. The real magic of this idea is that while the universe today

75
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,700
is extremely deadly and hostile, back then, the conditions for life might have been basically

76
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,220
everywhere. For a period that may have lasted several dozen million years, primordial life

77
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,200
might have been able to emerge on any rock, even between the stars, sowing the universe with the

78
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,660
seeds of what, billions of years later, would become bacteria, trilobites, dinosaurs, and finally

79
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,620
us. At some point, the universe cooled down below the right temperature for life to thrive,

80
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,380
but some of those ancestral life forms may have continued to exist in the internal warmth of the

81
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,260
first planets, frozen in asteroids or hibernating in cosmic dust, tiny seeds roaming the cosmos,

82
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,820
waiting for new hospitable places to continue evolving. If they did, life now might be

83
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:10,100
everywhere in the universe. Will we ever know? All this makes for a nice story, and while both

84
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,060
the habitability of the baby universe and our exponential clock of life are reasonable ideas,

85
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,620
they're still speculative, one more possibility among many others trying to explain our existence

86
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,620
today. But if life came to Earth from outer space, then it should have seeded other places in the

87
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:34,580
solar system too. Maybe there are fossils in dry riverbeds on Mars. Maybe we'll soon find life in

88
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,020
the warm underground oceans of Enceladus or Europa. Titan has seas, rivers, and lakes of

89
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,540
ethane and methane as warm as the universe when it was 90 million years old. So finding exotic

90
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,740
life on Titan would support the idea that life could have originated in the weird baby universe.

91
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,660
So far, when we look out into the cosmos, we don't see anyone like us. But maybe that's because life

92
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,620
needed 10 billion years or more to reach the level of complexity that allows for a technological

93
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,900
species. Maybe there are millions of worlds filled with microbes, oceans full of exotic fish,

94
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,900
and continents of bizarre animals. And maybe even others like us that just recently gained

95
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,820
consciousness and are beginning to look at the sky, wondering if they're alone. Life could be

96
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,620
flourishing right now in uncountable forms, and in all kinds of cosmic environments. And if many

97
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,140
of us share a common cosmic origin, we would all be part of a great cosmic family. The answer may

98
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:48,660
lie in our cosmic backyard. Let's go and find out. It's time. Let's reveal the 12,024 human
