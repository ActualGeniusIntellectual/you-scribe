00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
The 12,024 calendar is here. Get it now before it sells out, and stay tuned until the end

00:05.920 --> 00:10.680
of this video for a sneak peek that's out of this world.

00:10.680 --> 00:16.700
Life has existed on one planet for about 4 billion years, as far as we know. But it might

00:16.700 --> 00:22.440
have started right after the Big Bang, when the universe was much stranger and more fantastic

00:22.440 --> 00:29.720
than today. A universe that might have allowed life to develop absolutely anywhere. The cosmos

00:29.720 --> 00:35.080
might be full of the seeds of life, sleeping in a dead desert, waiting for a few drops

00:35.080 --> 00:43.780
of rain to explosively bloom and grow. Tiny and not-so-tiny aliens might be everywhere.

00:43.780 --> 00:48.020
In this video, we're going to put together two highly speculative yet scientifically

00:48.020 --> 00:53.360
grounded possibilities. Check out the scientific papers in our sources. To properly explain

00:53.360 --> 00:57.720
this, let's first look at the paradox of life on Earth.

00:57.720 --> 01:04.300
The Life Paradox. For its first few hundred million years, Earth was a magma hell, constantly

01:04.300 --> 01:09.760
bombarded by asteroids. But basically the second things calmed down and the first oceans

01:09.760 --> 01:15.520
formed, life just appeared, and zillions of microbes settled every nook and cranny they

01:15.520 --> 01:22.120
found. This is kind of strange. Life on Earth seems to be almost as old as the planet itself.

01:22.120 --> 01:27.840
As if it was waiting around for an opportunity. But life didn't only appear extremely quickly.

01:27.840 --> 01:34.440
In that tiny time window, it also crossed a huge gap. To qualify as living things, even

01:34.440 --> 01:40.900
microbes need to eat, poop, grow, and multiply. To do that, they need a genome, the biological

01:40.900 --> 01:46.800
instruction manual that sets the inner workings of an organism. How dead things with no genome

01:46.800 --> 01:52.480
become living things with genomes is one of the biggest riddles of science. Simplifying

01:52.480 --> 01:57.760
a lot, the problem is that to have a functioning genome, you need proteins, and to make those

01:57.760 --> 02:03.060
proteins, you need a functioning genome. Both proteins and genomes are super long molecules

02:03.060 --> 02:08.680
made of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult to assemble by chance. It's a chicken

02:08.680 --> 02:14.080
egg paradox with several chickens and eggs. Once you have a finished cell, the whole system

02:14.080 --> 02:19.740
works efficiently. But starting from simple dead stuff and reaching that level of sophistication

02:19.740 --> 02:26.340
by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error. So how did the

02:26.340 --> 02:32.040
first living things manage to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years? Most

02:32.040 --> 02:37.620
theories about the origin of life try to explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive

02:37.620 --> 02:43.800
soup of prebiotic molecules could have efficiently produced the first self-replicating entities.

02:43.800 --> 02:48.480
But we still don't know how exactly this would have worked. Maybe we need to think

02:48.480 --> 02:57.280
backwards. The clock of evolution. Think of genomes as a book telling the history of life.

02:57.280 --> 03:04.520
As time passed and life evolved, more characters were introduced. Amoeba, fish, amphibians,

03:04.520 --> 03:11.360
dinosaurs, and mammals. Over billions of years, the story of life got more and more complex.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.900
A genome can be viewed as a long string of letters with biological instructions. And

03:15.900 --> 03:21.000
from microbes to us today, functional genomes seem to have been increasing in size at a

03:21.000 --> 03:27.440
fairly constant rate. The functional genome of fish is more than twice that of worms.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.800
Our functional genome is about twice bigger than that of fish, and so on. It is a bit

03:31.800 --> 03:37.560
more complicated, but for now, let's run with this. When we put all these clues together,

03:37.560 --> 03:42.800
it seems that genomes have been doubling in size on average every 350 million years

03:42.800 --> 03:49.520
or so. As if evolution had been following an exponential inner clock. But it gets even

03:49.520 --> 03:56.180
stranger. The very first microbes that emerged on Earth, even if they look simple, already

03:56.180 --> 04:02.240
seem to have had pretty long and complex genomes. But how could life have achieved that level

04:02.240 --> 04:08.700
of complexity in such a short time? There may be an interesting way to solve this riddle.

04:08.700 --> 04:13.920
We just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time to the simplest conceivable

04:13.920 --> 04:20.120
life form, something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a few letters.

04:20.120 --> 04:26.880
But if we do that, we end up 10 billion years in the past, more than twice the age of Earth,

04:26.880 --> 04:33.120
which means, if life actually evolved like this, it didn't start here, but somewhere

04:33.120 --> 04:39.080
out there, in space. This would explain why life started to thrive so quickly on our young

04:39.080 --> 04:44.560
planet. If it was already present in space like a sea, it just needed water and warm

04:44.560 --> 04:49.940
temperatures to wake up and go on evolving. And it would also explain the high degree

04:49.940 --> 04:54.880
of sophistication of the first life forms on Earth. They could have been complex already,

04:54.880 --> 04:59.520
because they might have been evolving for billions of years somewhere else in the universe.

04:59.520 --> 05:06.180
But could life really be that old? Maybe, yes. Actually, life could have started shortly

05:06.180 --> 05:09.400
after the universe itself was born.

05:09.400 --> 05:16.740
A Goldilocks Baby Universe. At its most basic level, life needs two things. The right chemical

05:16.740 --> 05:21.720
elements to form complex molecules, and a liquid medium, like water, in which those

05:21.720 --> 05:27.400
molecules can move and interact. The liquid medium needs to stay warm enough to remain,

05:27.400 --> 05:33.200
well, liquid. So when we search for life in space, we focus on Earth-like planets at just

05:33.200 --> 05:38.480
the right distance from their star, warm enough to sustain liquid water. But there was actually

05:38.480 --> 05:44.120
a time when almost all of the universe might have been habitable. Right after the Big Bang,

05:44.120 --> 05:50.440
the universe was extremely hot. But as the cosmos expanded, it cooled. And between about

05:50.440 --> 05:55.400
10 and 17 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was a thousand times younger

05:55.400 --> 06:03.420
than today, it was between 100°C and 0°C, the temperature at which water is liquid.

06:03.420 --> 06:10.040
So for this window of time, more than 13.7 billion years ago, the whole universe, absolutely

06:10.040 --> 06:15.940
every inch of it, had the right temperature to support life. Of course, the right temperature

06:15.940 --> 06:21.340
alone is not enough for life. We also need chemical elements like carbon and oxygen,

06:21.340 --> 06:26.980
which are forged in the cores of stars. But were there stars in super early cosmic times?

06:26.980 --> 06:33.480
Maybe, yes, in regions of the universe where matter was especially dense. Such stars would

06:33.480 --> 06:38.460
have been very massive and gone supernova in just 3 million years, sealing the baby

06:38.460 --> 06:43.340
universe with the chemical elements needed to form dust, asteroids, planets, and the

06:43.340 --> 06:50.220
ingredients of life. Maybe the first ancestors of life were more exotic and didn't even need

06:50.220 --> 06:55.660
water but thrived in substances like ammonia or ethane that can stay liquid at temperatures

06:55.660 --> 07:01.700
far below 0°C. They could have been sustained by the lingering warmth of the Big Bang for

07:01.700 --> 07:07.020
tens of millions of years longer, well into a time when we know for sure there were stars

07:07.020 --> 07:12.580
and all the chemical elements. The real magic of this idea is that while the universe today

07:12.580 --> 07:17.700
is extremely deadly and hostile, back then, the conditions for life might have been basically

07:17.700 --> 07:23.220
everywhere. For a period that may have lasted several dozen million years, primordial life

07:23.220 --> 07:29.200
might have been able to emerge on any rock, even between the stars, sowing the universe with the

07:29.200 --> 07:36.660
seeds of what, billions of years later, would become bacteria, trilobites, dinosaurs, and finally

07:36.660 --> 07:42.620
us. At some point, the universe cooled down below the right temperature for life to thrive,

07:42.620 --> 07:48.380
but some of those ancestral life forms may have continued to exist in the internal warmth of the

07:48.380 --> 07:55.260
first planets, frozen in asteroids or hibernating in cosmic dust, tiny seeds roaming the cosmos,

07:55.260 --> 08:01.820
waiting for new hospitable places to continue evolving. If they did, life now might be

08:01.820 --> 08:10.100
everywhere in the universe. Will we ever know? All this makes for a nice story, and while both

08:10.100 --> 08:15.060
the habitability of the baby universe and our exponential clock of life are reasonable ideas,

08:15.060 --> 08:21.620
they're still speculative, one more possibility among many others trying to explain our existence

08:21.620 --> 08:27.620
today. But if life came to Earth from outer space, then it should have seeded other places in the

08:27.620 --> 08:34.580
solar system too. Maybe there are fossils in dry riverbeds on Mars. Maybe we'll soon find life in

08:34.580 --> 08:41.020
the warm underground oceans of Enceladus or Europa. Titan has seas, rivers, and lakes of

08:41.020 --> 08:47.540
ethane and methane as warm as the universe when it was 90 million years old. So finding exotic

08:47.540 --> 08:53.740
life on Titan would support the idea that life could have originated in the weird baby universe.

08:53.860 --> 09:00.660
So far, when we look out into the cosmos, we don't see anyone like us. But maybe that's because life

09:00.660 --> 09:05.620
needed 10 billion years or more to reach the level of complexity that allows for a technological

09:05.620 --> 09:11.900
species. Maybe there are millions of worlds filled with microbes, oceans full of exotic fish,

09:11.900 --> 09:18.900
and continents of bizarre animals. And maybe even others like us that just recently gained

09:18.940 --> 09:25.820
consciousness and are beginning to look at the sky, wondering if they're alone. Life could be

09:25.820 --> 09:31.620
flourishing right now in uncountable forms, and in all kinds of cosmic environments. And if many

09:31.620 --> 09:38.140
of us share a common cosmic origin, we would all be part of a great cosmic family. The answer may

09:38.140 --> 09:48.660
lie in our cosmic backyard. Let's go and find out. It's time. Let's reveal the 12,024 human
