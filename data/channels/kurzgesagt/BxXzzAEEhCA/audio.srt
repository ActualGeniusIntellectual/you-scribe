1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Spending your entire life in space.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,880
If there's another planet suitable for humans, it will be quite a long journey to get there.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,680
Even traveling at 1% of the speed of light, it would still take 10,000 years to go only 100 light years.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,400
This means that the people who get on an interstellar spaceship will not be the ones who arrive.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
Such a ship requires everything needed for a journey lasting thousands of years,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,440
meaning you have to take everything on board.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,520
New parts for repairs, food, and even new crew to replace you when you die.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,160
Hundreds of generations may live and die knowing only a spaceship is their home.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,880
You might be okay with leaving Earth never to return,

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,120
but that means you're making the same decision for your children and grandchildren.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,320
Is that ethical?

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,600
Imagine if your entire purpose in life was to just maintain the life support systems on a spaceship

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,880
so that one day your descendants could see a new world.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,200
Would you be okay with someone deciding before you're born that you're going to be...
