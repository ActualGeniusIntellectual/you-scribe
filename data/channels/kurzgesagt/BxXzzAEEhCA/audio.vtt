00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Spending your entire life in space.

00:02.640 --> 00:06.880
If there's another planet suitable for humans, it will be quite a long journey to get there.

00:06.880 --> 00:13.680
Even traveling at 1% of the speed of light, it would still take 10,000 years to go only 100 light years.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.400
This means that the people who get on an interstellar spaceship will not be the ones who arrive.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.960
Such a ship requires everything needed for a journey lasting thousands of years,

00:22.960 --> 00:25.440
meaning you have to take everything on board.

00:25.440 --> 00:31.520
New parts for repairs, food, and even new crew to replace you when you die.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.160
Hundreds of generations may live and die knowing only a spaceship is their home.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.880
You might be okay with leaving Earth never to return,

00:38.880 --> 00:43.120
but that means you're making the same decision for your children and grandchildren.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.320
Is that ethical?

00:44.320 --> 00:49.600
Imagine if your entire purpose in life was to just maintain the life support systems on a spaceship

00:49.600 --> 00:52.880
so that one day your descendants could see a new world.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.200
Would you be okay with someone deciding before you're born that you're going to be...
