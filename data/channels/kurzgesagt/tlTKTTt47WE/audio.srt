1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What if we are not creators, but creations?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If our current understanding of physics is correct,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But we don't actually need to anyway.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation into thinking that they're real.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who needs billions of galaxies?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The vast universe could just be a flat projection and they would have no way to know.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What about small things like cells or bacteria?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We don't really need them.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly created.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Same with atoms.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We just need the outermost layer of it.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things, but it might be empty until you open it.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, so are we being simulated?

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Obviously, we have no authority over this topic, so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom, we have five assumptions for you.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If they're true, you, dear viewer, are living in a simulation.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Assumption one.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's possible to simulate consciousness.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nobody knows what consciousness is.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Brains are pretty complex.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you count every interaction between synapses as one operation, your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
or 100 million billion operations per second.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations to simulate one second of human consciousness.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But we don't want to simulate just one human.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's say we want to simulate 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of 50 years.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years times 200 billion humans times 10 to the power of 20 operations.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations per second.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
More operations than there are stars in the observable universe.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A computer like this is just impossible.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Except, maybe it isn't.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Assumption two.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Technological progress will not stop anytime soon.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If we assume that technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then there might be galaxy-spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them from gods.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations is serious business,

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The matryoshka brain is a theoretical megastructure made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A computer of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands, if not millions, of humanities at the same time.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Other technologies, like high-end future quantum computers, might lower the size drastically,

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city, or even smaller.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But only if there's still someone around to build the computer.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Assumption three.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If there is a point at which all civilizations destroy themselves, this whole discussion ends here.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Looking into space, you'd expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilizations, but we see nobody.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The reason for this might be great filters.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Great filters are barriers life has to overcome, like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change, or a black hole generator.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We explain this in more detail in our Fermi Paradox video.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Assumption four.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When we speak of post-human civilizations, we don't know what we're dealing with.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Imagine the smartest ant on Earth living next to an amusement park.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's curious about what humans are up to, so you try to explain.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The concept of roller coasters and standing in lines and holidays and fun doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's the same with us and a post-human being.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Compared to them, we are ants.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But, if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons, and assumptions one to three are true too,

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Assumption five.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If there are a lot of simulations, you are probably inside a simulation.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If there are simulated civilizations, it's likely that there are a lot of them.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
After all, we assume that post-human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If there are billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed are simulated.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So, for every conscious being made of flesh, a billion simulated ones exist.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
in this case, the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulated ones are pretty high.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So what you consider reality might not be real at all.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You really might be simulated.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now,

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
so many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If you are simulated, not that much changes for you.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness or a simulation inside a computer.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time,

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer, nobody trips over the power cable.

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh no, I think I just unplugged the simulation.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But what if that doesn't matter?

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What if we are in one right now?

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What if you are simulated?

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Jake over at Vsauce3 is looking into that.
