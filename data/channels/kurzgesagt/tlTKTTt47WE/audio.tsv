0	6000	We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered.
6000	10000	Our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world.
10000	15000	So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.
15000	19000	Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,
19000	23000	it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.
23000	28000	In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes.
28000	33000	But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened?
33000	38000	What if we are not creators, but creations?
38000	43000	Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?
43000	56000	If our current understanding of physics is correct,
56000	61000	then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things.
61000	63000	But we don't actually need to anyway.
63000	70000	We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation into thinking that they're real.
70000	72000	Who needs billions of galaxies?
72000	76000	We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.
76000	82000	The vast universe could just be a flat projection and they would have no way to know.
82000	87000	What about small things like cells or bacteria?
87000	89000	We don't really need them.
89000	94000	When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly created.
94000	96000	Same with atoms.
96000	101000	The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms.
101000	103000	We just need the outermost layer of it.
103000	107000	It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.
107000	114000	Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things, but it might be empty until you open it.
114000	120000	The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.
120000	124000	Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.
124000	128000	Okay, so are we being simulated?
128000	133000	Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.
133000	139000	Obviously, we have no authority over this topic, so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.
139000	146000	Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom, we have five assumptions for you.
146000	151000	If they're true, you, dear viewer, are living in a simulation.
151000	153000	Assumption one.
153000	156000	It's possible to simulate consciousness.
157000	159000	Nobody knows what consciousness is.
159000	165000	For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.
165000	168000	Brains are pretty complex.
169000	175000	If you count every interaction between synapses as one operation, your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17,
175000	180000	or 100 million billion operations per second.
180000	186000	Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations to simulate one second of human consciousness.
186000	189000	But we don't want to simulate just one human.
189000	193000	We want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around.
193000	198000	Let's say we want to simulate 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of 50 years.
198000	206000	One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years times 200 billion humans times 10 to the power of 20 operations.
207000	215000	So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations per second.
215000	219000	More operations than there are stars in the observable universe.
219000	222000	A computer like this is just impossible.
222000	224000	Except, maybe it isn't.
225000	227000	Assumption two.
227000	230000	Technological progress will not stop anytime soon.
231000	236000	If we assume that technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,
236000	241000	then there might be galaxy-spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point.
241000	247000	Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them from gods.
247000	252000	A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations is serious business,
252000	256000	but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.
256000	263000	The matryoshka brain is a theoretical megastructure made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation.
263000	270000	A computer of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands, if not millions, of humanities at the same time.
270000	276000	Other technologies, like high-end future quantum computers, might lower the size drastically,
276000	281000	so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city, or even smaller.
281000	285000	But only if there's still someone around to build the computer.
286000	287000	Assumption three.
287000	291000	Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.
291000	297000	If there is a point at which all civilizations destroy themselves, this whole discussion ends here.
297000	304000	Looking into space, you'd expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilizations, but we see nobody.
304000	307000	The reason for this might be great filters.
307000	315000	Great filters are barriers life has to overcome, like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change, or a black hole generator.
315000	320000	If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.
320000	324000	We explain this in more detail in our Fermi Paradox video.
324000	327000	Assumption four.
327000	331000	Super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.
331000	336000	When we speak of post-human civilizations, we don't know what we're dealing with.
336000	341000	To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.
342000	346000	Imagine the smartest ant on Earth living next to an amusement park.
346000	350000	It's curious about what humans are up to, so you try to explain.
350000	354000	Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.
354000	361000	The concept of roller coasters and standing in lines and holidays and fun doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.
361000	365000	It's the same with us and a post-human being.
365000	367000	Compared to them, we are ants.
367000	372000	Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.
372000	379000	But, if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons, and assumptions one to three are true too,
379000	384000	then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.
384000	386000	Assumption five.
386000	391000	If there are a lot of simulations, you are probably inside a simulation.
391000	396000	If there are simulated civilizations, it's likely that there are a lot of them.
396000	402000	After all, we assume that post-human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.
402000	407000	So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.
407000	414000	If there are billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,
414000	420000	which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed are simulated.
420000	425000	So, for every conscious being made of flesh, a billion simulated ones exist.
426000	430000	Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,
430000	438000	in this case, the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulated ones are pretty high.
438000	442000	So what you consider reality might not be real at all.
442000	445000	You really might be simulated.
446000	450000	All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now,
450000	454000	so many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.
454000	458000	So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.
458000	461000	If you are simulated, not that much changes for you.
461000	467000	You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness or a simulation inside a computer.
467000	471000	Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.
471000	475000	All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time,
475000	481000	and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer, nobody trips over the power cable.
485000	489000	Oh no, I think I just unplugged the simulation.
489000	492000	But what if that doesn't matter?
492000	494000	What if we are in one right now?
494000	497000	What if you are simulated?
