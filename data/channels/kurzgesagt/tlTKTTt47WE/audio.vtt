00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
What if we are not creators, but creations?

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?

00:43.000 --> 00:56.000
If our current understanding of physics is correct,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
But we don't actually need to anyway.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation into thinking that they're real.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Who needs billions of galaxies?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
The vast universe could just be a flat projection and they would have no way to know.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
What about small things like cells or bacteria?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
We don't really need them.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly created.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Same with atoms.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
We just need the outermost layer of it.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things, but it might be empty until you open it.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay, so are we being simulated?

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
Obviously, we have no authority over this topic, so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom, we have five assumptions for you.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
If they're true, you, dear viewer, are living in a simulation.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Assumption one.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
It's possible to simulate consciousness.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Nobody knows what consciousness is.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Brains are pretty complex.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
If you count every interaction between synapses as one operation, your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17,

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
or 100 million billion operations per second.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations to simulate one second of human consciousness.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
But we don't want to simulate just one human.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
We want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Let's say we want to simulate 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of 50 years.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years times 200 billion humans times 10 to the power of 20 operations.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations per second.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
More operations than there are stars in the observable universe.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
A computer like this is just impossible.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Except, maybe it isn't.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Assumption two.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Technological progress will not stop anytime soon.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
If we assume that technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
then there might be galaxy-spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them from gods.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations is serious business,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
The matryoshka brain is a theoretical megastructure made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
A computer of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands, if not millions, of humanities at the same time.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Other technologies, like high-end future quantum computers, might lower the size drastically,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city, or even smaller.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
But only if there's still someone around to build the computer.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Assumption three.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
If there is a point at which all civilizations destroy themselves, this whole discussion ends here.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
Looking into space, you'd expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilizations, but we see nobody.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
The reason for this might be great filters.

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
Great filters are barriers life has to overcome, like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change, or a black hole generator.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
We explain this in more detail in our Fermi Paradox video.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Assumption four.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
When we speak of post-human civilizations, we don't know what we're dealing with.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Imagine the smartest ant on Earth living next to an amusement park.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
It's curious about what humans are up to, so you try to explain.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
The concept of roller coasters and standing in lines and holidays and fun doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
It's the same with us and a post-human being.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Compared to them, we are ants.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
But, if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons, and assumptions one to three are true too,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Assumption five.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
If there are a lot of simulations, you are probably inside a simulation.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
If there are simulated civilizations, it's likely that there are a lot of them.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
After all, we assume that post-human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
If there are billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed are simulated.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
So, for every conscious being made of flesh, a billion simulated ones exist.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
in this case, the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulated ones are pretty high.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
So what you consider reality might not be real at all.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You really might be simulated.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
so many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
If you are simulated, not that much changes for you.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness or a simulation inside a computer.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time,

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer, nobody trips over the power cable.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh no, I think I just unplugged the simulation.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
But what if that doesn't matter?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What if we are in one right now?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
What if you are simulated?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
