00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Absolutely everything you think about yourself and the universe could be an illusion.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
As far as you know, you are real and exist in a universe that was born 14 billion years ago,

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
and that gave rise to galaxies, stars, the Earth, and finally you.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Except, maybe not.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
You may actually not exist for real, but be the dream of a dead universe.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
You, and everything you think exists.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Crazy as it sounds, this may be an unavoidable consequence of our best scientific theories about the universe.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Okay, this is a bit much. Let's start at the beginning.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
We need to understand three concepts for this idea to make sense.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
One, the arrow of time.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
What distinguishes the past from the future?

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Put a drop of red ink into a glass of water, and you see the ink spread until it fills the container, but never the opposite.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Coloured water, where ink spontaneously concentrates and becomes a drop at the surface again.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Time always seems to flow in the direction in which the ink spreads.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
But if you take a microscope, all you will see will be a swarm of molecules colliding at random.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
There are no rules, no forwards and backwards.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Every individual motion that happens can occur in reverse.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
But we perceive a sort of arrow of time that makes things happen in one direction.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
How does this phenomenon occur?

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, this arrow of time is not actually fundamental, but a matter of probability.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
When ink molecules spread to fill a glass, there are many different slots of space they can occupy, and therefore many different possibilities to combine them.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
And just like your chances of winning the lottery grow the more tickets you have,

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
the probability that ink molecules will end up filling the glass is much higher than the probability that they'll concentrate in just one spot.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
So it's not that the ink forming a drop again is forbidden by the laws of physics, it's just extremely unlikely.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
To see it, you'd have to wait about ten to the power of one hundred six dillion years.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
A one followed by one hundred six dillion zeroes.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
If you had this much time to spare, eventually, by pure random chance, you'd see a red blob form again.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Actually, with enough time, you could see any shape forming.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Like, for example, a small, red, soggy brain.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Okay, let's move on to idea two.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Our universe was born fourteen billion years ago in the big bang.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
It expanded and evolved to give rise to the myriads of galaxies and things.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
In other words, the universe is kind of a glass of water with a lot of ink doing stuff.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
It has an arrow of time.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
But the universe is not a static glass, it seems to be getting bigger at an ever increasing speed because of dark energy.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Basically, everything in it is getting more and more diluted.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
In about one hundred trillion years, the last star will die.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
Then, few interesting things will happen for the next few decillions, vantillions, and googles of years.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Eventually, the universe will be a dark place fully dominated by dark energy.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
A rapidly expanding ball of pure space, almost devoid of matter.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
You might think that this would lead to the ultimate death of everything, but dark energy has one last surprise for you.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
In a universe dominated by dark energy, space expands so dramatically that it creates a cosmic horizon around you.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
A border beyond which nothing will ever be able to reach you, not even light.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
So for every practical purpose, the universe has become a glass of finite size about thirty-six billion light years wide,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
surrounded by an impassable cosmic horizon.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Such a universe glass is basically a giant black hole turned inside out.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
We know that due to quantum effects, all black holes emit a tiny amount of particles, a phenomenon known as Hawking radiation.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And so does our inside out black hole.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
In the end, this radiation will fill the universe glass with particles again.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
At this point, so far in the future that giving you a number has no more meaning, we've reached the true final state.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
The universe has now become a closed box full of particles at an extremely low, but finite temperature.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
And since they have a temperature, they undergo random motions.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Or in other words, a glass filled with water and ink, and an infinite amount of time ahead.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Things are about to become interesting again.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Eternity is a long, long time.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
So now, even the most extremely unlikely things can happen.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
The fluctuating particles are bumping into each other over and over and over again, creating every combination of particles that's possible.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
They're like a monkey typing at random on a typewriter.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Almost all of the time it types gibberish.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
But with enough time, eventually it will write the first acts of Hamlet.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
And with even more time, the complete works of M&M.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
If ink in our universe glass generates any random arrangements of particles, what could they be?

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, a spontaneous fluctuation could give rise to a planet, or to a galaxy, or even to a lot of them.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
So maybe our universe has already ended, and all we see around us is a pop-up universe.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Not a universe that evolved from a big bang, but one that fluctuated into existence by pure chance.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
And that, like the drop of ink, will only exist for a while before dissolving again.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Being random, pop-up universes could be similar to ours, but with funny glitches.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
In some of these universes, dinosaurs are riding snails.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
In another, stars are made of blueberries.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
In another, you're wearing a funny hat.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Scientists in such universes wouldn't understand those glitches,

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
so maybe the greatest mysteries of physics are just nonsense bugs of our pop-up universe.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
But not all possible fluctuations of our dead universe have the same probability of occurring.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Smaller fluctuations are much more probable than bigger ones.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
A planet is more likely than a galaxy.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But you know what's even way more likely?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
A human brain.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Are you actually just a brain?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
You think, therefore you exist.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
But what else do you truly know?

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
In the end, your brain is just interpreting signals from your senses and creating a world that you experience.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
So technically, you could be just your brain that thinks the world is real.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And if we follow the logic of the Ink in the Universe class,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
in particular, you could be a disembodied brain that, just by chance,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
emerged in a dead universe with your complete set of knowledge and memories.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
This is a pretty bizarre idea.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
But if we do the maths, it's kind of pretty solid.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Let's compare the number of brains inside bodies in a living universe

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
with the number of naked brains in a dead universe.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Let's go really big and imagine that a total of 100 quadrillion humans will live around Earth.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And that the same amount of people will live around every star in the universe.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
If we add this together, we get about 10 to the power of 41 brains inside bodies that will exist.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
However, in a dead universe that has had enough time to explore all possible fluctuations and that will exist forever,

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
the number of naked brains that would emerge is, well, infinite.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
So the probability that you're a floating brain is not only vastly larger than the probability that you're a real human,

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
it's so inconceivably larger that we can't even meaningfully quantify the difference.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
How do you compare a number to infinity?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
So, are you a floating brain that exists for one moment in time,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
then basically forever passes, and then you exist for another moment in time?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Maybe not even in that order.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Maybe your life happens backwards and you just don't notice.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Maybe you've lived trillions of times already.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Are you the dream of a dead universe?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Really? Like, really?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, probably not.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
First of all, there are a few loopholes.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
For example, dark energy could behave completely differently from what we think today and lead us to another future.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Or maybe our dead universe will be too motionless to allow the creation of brains even with infinite time.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Or maybe the universe will end up dying in another way.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Our understanding of the cosmos doesn't have a solid enough foundation for anyone to worry if they're real or not.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Loopholes aside, if you were a fluctuating brain,

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
all the laws of physics stored in your brain would have originated at random and shouldn't bear any relation to the real world.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
But we just used those laws to prove that you're a floating brain.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So even if you believe that you are a floating brain,

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
you'd have to admit that you have no good reason to believe that you are actually a floating brain.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
Okay, so this hallucinatory trip might teach us something about our theories about the universe.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
But in the end, it's just a really weird exercise in what you can do with physics.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
An exercise of what brains and bodies are able to think about.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
So don't worry, you're not a dream of the dead universe.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Probably.

08:39.000 --> 08:49.000
At Kurzgesagt, we love discussing topics like Boltzmann Brains because we're convinced that taking science and philosophy seriously is really important for having a positive impact on the world.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
We're lucky because this is our job.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Doing something impactful, we also enjoy.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
If you're also aiming to make a positive difference, where should you start?

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
Well, we've noticed a lot of advice about having a positive impact isn't based on the best available evidence.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Today's sponsor, 80,000 Hours, aims to offer some that is.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
80,000 Hours is a non-profit career advice organization that wants to help people find fulfilling careers that also do a lot of good in the world.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
And their advice is free to read online without any hidden cost or fee later on.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
They've spent the last decade compiling and conducting research into topics like how much impact can one person actually have?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And what are the best ways to make a positive difference on important global issues?

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
And like us, they care a lot about making sure their work is based on the best available evidence and consultation with experts.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
You can read their main takeaways and actionable advice in their free online career guide that's recently got a massive update for 2023.

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
