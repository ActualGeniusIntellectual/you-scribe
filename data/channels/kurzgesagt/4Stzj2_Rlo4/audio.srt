1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Absolutely everything you think about yourself and the universe could be an illusion.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
As far as you know, you are real and exist in a universe that was born 14 billion years ago,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that gave rise to galaxies, stars, the Earth, and finally you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Except, maybe not.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You may actually not exist for real, but be the dream of a dead universe.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You, and everything you think exists.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Crazy as it sounds, this may be an unavoidable consequence of our best scientific theories about the universe.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, this is a bit much. Let's start at the beginning.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We need to understand three concepts for this idea to make sense.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One, the arrow of time.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What distinguishes the past from the future?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Put a drop of red ink into a glass of water, and you see the ink spread until it fills the container, but never the opposite.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Coloured water, where ink spontaneously concentrates and becomes a drop at the surface again.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Time always seems to flow in the direction in which the ink spreads.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But if you take a microscope, all you will see will be a swarm of molecules colliding at random.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There are no rules, no forwards and backwards.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Every individual motion that happens can occur in reverse.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But we perceive a sort of arrow of time that makes things happen in one direction.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How does this phenomenon occur?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, this arrow of time is not actually fundamental, but a matter of probability.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When ink molecules spread to fill a glass, there are many different slots of space they can occupy, and therefore many different possibilities to combine them.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And just like your chances of winning the lottery grow the more tickets you have,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the probability that ink molecules will end up filling the glass is much higher than the probability that they'll concentrate in just one spot.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So it's not that the ink forming a drop again is forbidden by the laws of physics, it's just extremely unlikely.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
To see it, you'd have to wait about ten to the power of one hundred six dillion years.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A one followed by one hundred six dillion zeroes.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you had this much time to spare, eventually, by pure random chance, you'd see a red blob form again.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Actually, with enough time, you could see any shape forming.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Like, for example, a small, red, soggy brain.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, let's move on to idea two.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Our universe was born fourteen billion years ago in the big bang.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It expanded and evolved to give rise to the myriads of galaxies and things.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In other words, the universe is kind of a glass of water with a lot of ink doing stuff.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It has an arrow of time.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But the universe is not a static glass, it seems to be getting bigger at an ever increasing speed because of dark energy.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Basically, everything in it is getting more and more diluted.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In about one hundred trillion years, the last star will die.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Then, few interesting things will happen for the next few decillions, vantillions, and googles of years.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Eventually, the universe will be a dark place fully dominated by dark energy.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
A rapidly expanding ball of pure space, almost devoid of matter.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You might think that this would lead to the ultimate death of everything, but dark energy has one last surprise for you.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In a universe dominated by dark energy, space expands so dramatically that it creates a cosmic horizon around you.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A border beyond which nothing will ever be able to reach you, not even light.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So for every practical purpose, the universe has become a glass of finite size about thirty-six billion light years wide,

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
surrounded by an impassable cosmic horizon.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Such a universe glass is basically a giant black hole turned inside out.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We know that due to quantum effects, all black holes emit a tiny amount of particles, a phenomenon known as Hawking radiation.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And so does our inside out black hole.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In the end, this radiation will fill the universe glass with particles again.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
At this point, so far in the future that giving you a number has no more meaning, we've reached the true final state.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The universe has now become a closed box full of particles at an extremely low, but finite temperature.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And since they have a temperature, they undergo random motions.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Or in other words, a glass filled with water and ink, and an infinite amount of time ahead.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Things are about to become interesting again.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Eternity is a long, long time.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So now, even the most extremely unlikely things can happen.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The fluctuating particles are bumping into each other over and over and over again, creating every combination of particles that's possible.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They're like a monkey typing at random on a typewriter.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Almost all of the time it types gibberish.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But with enough time, eventually it will write the first acts of Hamlet.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And with even more time, the complete works of M&M.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If ink in our universe glass generates any random arrangements of particles, what could they be?

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, a spontaneous fluctuation could give rise to a planet, or to a galaxy, or even to a lot of them.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So maybe our universe has already ended, and all we see around us is a pop-up universe.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Not a universe that evolved from a big bang, but one that fluctuated into existence by pure chance.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And that, like the drop of ink, will only exist for a while before dissolving again.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Being random, pop-up universes could be similar to ours, but with funny glitches.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In some of these universes, dinosaurs are riding snails.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In another, stars are made of blueberries.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In another, you're wearing a funny hat.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Scientists in such universes wouldn't understand those glitches,

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
so maybe the greatest mysteries of physics are just nonsense bugs of our pop-up universe.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But not all possible fluctuations of our dead universe have the same probability of occurring.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Smaller fluctuations are much more probable than bigger ones.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A planet is more likely than a galaxy.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you know what's even way more likely?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A human brain.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you actually just a brain?

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You think, therefore you exist.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But what else do you truly know?

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In the end, your brain is just interpreting signals from your senses and creating a world that you experience.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So technically, you could be just your brain that thinks the world is real.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And if we follow the logic of the Ink in the Universe class,

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in particular, you could be a disembodied brain that, just by chance,

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
emerged in a dead universe with your complete set of knowledge and memories.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is a pretty bizarre idea.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But if we do the maths, it's kind of pretty solid.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's compare the number of brains inside bodies in a living universe

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
with the number of naked brains in a dead universe.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's go really big and imagine that a total of 100 quadrillion humans will live around Earth.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And that the same amount of people will live around every star in the universe.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If we add this together, we get about 10 to the power of 41 brains inside bodies that will exist.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
However, in a dead universe that has had enough time to explore all possible fluctuations and that will exist forever,

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the number of naked brains that would emerge is, well, infinite.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So the probability that you're a floating brain is not only vastly larger than the probability that you're a real human,

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
it's so inconceivably larger that we can't even meaningfully quantify the difference.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How do you compare a number to infinity?

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So, are you a floating brain that exists for one moment in time,

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
then basically forever passes, and then you exist for another moment in time?

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Maybe not even in that order.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe your life happens backwards and you just don't notice.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe you've lived trillions of times already.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Are you the dream of a dead universe?

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Really? Like, really?

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, probably not.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
First of all, there are a few loopholes.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For example, dark energy could behave completely differently from what we think today and lead us to another future.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or maybe our dead universe will be too motionless to allow the creation of brains even with infinite time.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or maybe the universe will end up dying in another way.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Our understanding of the cosmos doesn't have a solid enough foundation for anyone to worry if they're real or not.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Loopholes aside, if you were a fluctuating brain,

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
all the laws of physics stored in your brain would have originated at random and shouldn't bear any relation to the real world.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But we just used those laws to prove that you're a floating brain.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So even if you believe that you are a floating brain,

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you'd have to admit that you have no good reason to believe that you are actually a floating brain.

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, so this hallucinatory trip might teach us something about our theories about the universe.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But in the end, it's just a really weird exercise in what you can do with physics.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
An exercise of what brains and bodies are able to think about.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So don't worry, you're not a dream of the dead universe.

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Probably.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
At Kurzgesagt, we love discussing topics like Boltzmann Brains because we're convinced that taking science and philosophy seriously is really important for having a positive impact on the world.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We're lucky because this is our job.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Doing something impactful, we also enjoy.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you're also aiming to make a positive difference, where should you start?

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, we've noticed a lot of advice about having a positive impact isn't based on the best available evidence.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Today's sponsor, 80,000 Hours, aims to offer some that is.

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
80,000 Hours is a non-profit career advice organization that wants to help people find fulfilling careers that also do a lot of good in the world.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They've spent the last decade compiling and conducting research into topics like how much impact can one person actually have?

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And what are the best ways to make a positive difference on important global issues?

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And like us, they care a lot about making sure their work is based on the best available evidence and consultation with experts.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can read their main takeaways and actionable advice in their free online career guide that's recently got a massive update for 2023.
