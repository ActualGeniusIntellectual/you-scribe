0	5000	Absolutely everything you think about yourself and the universe could be an illusion.
5000	10000	As far as you know, you are real and exist in a universe that was born 14 billion years ago,
10000	14000	and that gave rise to galaxies, stars, the Earth, and finally you.
14000	17000	Except, maybe not.
17000	22000	You may actually not exist for real, but be the dream of a dead universe.
22000	25000	You, and everything you think exists.
25000	32000	Crazy as it sounds, this may be an unavoidable consequence of our best scientific theories about the universe.
32000	35000	Okay, this is a bit much. Let's start at the beginning.
35000	39000	We need to understand three concepts for this idea to make sense.
39000	42000	One, the arrow of time.
42000	45000	What distinguishes the past from the future?
45000	52000	Put a drop of red ink into a glass of water, and you see the ink spread until it fills the container, but never the opposite.
52000	57000	Coloured water, where ink spontaneously concentrates and becomes a drop at the surface again.
57000	61000	Time always seems to flow in the direction in which the ink spreads.
61000	66000	But if you take a microscope, all you will see will be a swarm of molecules colliding at random.
66000	69000	There are no rules, no forwards and backwards.
69000	73000	Every individual motion that happens can occur in reverse.
73000	77000	But we perceive a sort of arrow of time that makes things happen in one direction.
77000	80000	How does this phenomenon occur?
80000	85000	Well, this arrow of time is not actually fundamental, but a matter of probability.
85000	93000	When ink molecules spread to fill a glass, there are many different slots of space they can occupy, and therefore many different possibilities to combine them.
93000	97000	And just like your chances of winning the lottery grow the more tickets you have,
97000	104000	the probability that ink molecules will end up filling the glass is much higher than the probability that they'll concentrate in just one spot.
104000	111000	So it's not that the ink forming a drop again is forbidden by the laws of physics, it's just extremely unlikely.
111000	116000	To see it, you'd have to wait about ten to the power of one hundred six dillion years.
116000	119000	A one followed by one hundred six dillion zeroes.
119000	125000	If you had this much time to spare, eventually, by pure random chance, you'd see a red blob form again.
125000	128000	Actually, with enough time, you could see any shape forming.
128000	132000	Like, for example, a small, red, soggy brain.
132000	134000	Okay, let's move on to idea two.
138000	142000	Our universe was born fourteen billion years ago in the big bang.
142000	146000	It expanded and evolved to give rise to the myriads of galaxies and things.
146000	151000	In other words, the universe is kind of a glass of water with a lot of ink doing stuff.
151000	153000	It has an arrow of time.
153000	159000	But the universe is not a static glass, it seems to be getting bigger at an ever increasing speed because of dark energy.
159000	163000	Basically, everything in it is getting more and more diluted.
163000	167000	In about one hundred trillion years, the last star will die.
167000	173000	Then, few interesting things will happen for the next few decillions, vantillions, and googles of years.
173000	177000	Eventually, the universe will be a dark place fully dominated by dark energy.
177000	181000	A rapidly expanding ball of pure space, almost devoid of matter.
181000	188000	You might think that this would lead to the ultimate death of everything, but dark energy has one last surprise for you.
188000	195000	In a universe dominated by dark energy, space expands so dramatically that it creates a cosmic horizon around you.
195000	199000	A border beyond which nothing will ever be able to reach you, not even light.
199000	206000	So for every practical purpose, the universe has become a glass of finite size about thirty-six billion light years wide,
206000	209000	surrounded by an impassable cosmic horizon.
209000	213000	Such a universe glass is basically a giant black hole turned inside out.
214000	220000	We know that due to quantum effects, all black holes emit a tiny amount of particles, a phenomenon known as Hawking radiation.
220000	223000	And so does our inside out black hole.
223000	227000	In the end, this radiation will fill the universe glass with particles again.
227000	233000	At this point, so far in the future that giving you a number has no more meaning, we've reached the true final state.
233000	239000	The universe has now become a closed box full of particles at an extremely low, but finite temperature.
239000	242000	And since they have a temperature, they undergo random motions.
242000	248000	Or in other words, a glass filled with water and ink, and an infinite amount of time ahead.
248000	251000	Things are about to become interesting again.
257000	261000	Eternity is a long, long time.
261000	265000	So now, even the most extremely unlikely things can happen.
265000	272000	The fluctuating particles are bumping into each other over and over and over again, creating every combination of particles that's possible.
272000	275000	They're like a monkey typing at random on a typewriter.
275000	277000	Almost all of the time it types gibberish.
277000	281000	But with enough time, eventually it will write the first acts of Hamlet.
281000	285000	And with even more time, the complete works of M&M.
285000	291000	If ink in our universe glass generates any random arrangements of particles, what could they be?
291000	298000	Well, a spontaneous fluctuation could give rise to a planet, or to a galaxy, or even to a lot of them.
298000	304000	So maybe our universe has already ended, and all we see around us is a pop-up universe.
304000	309000	Not a universe that evolved from a big bang, but one that fluctuated into existence by pure chance.
309000	314000	And that, like the drop of ink, will only exist for a while before dissolving again.
314000	318000	Being random, pop-up universes could be similar to ours, but with funny glitches.
318000	322000	In some of these universes, dinosaurs are riding snails.
322000	324000	In another, stars are made of blueberries.
324000	327000	In another, you're wearing a funny hat.
327000	330000	Scientists in such universes wouldn't understand those glitches,
330000	336000	so maybe the greatest mysteries of physics are just nonsense bugs of our pop-up universe.
336000	341000	But not all possible fluctuations of our dead universe have the same probability of occurring.
341000	344000	Smaller fluctuations are much more probable than bigger ones.
344000	346000	A planet is more likely than a galaxy.
346000	348000	But you know what's even way more likely?
348000	350000	A human brain.
351000	354000	Are you actually just a brain?
354000	356000	You think, therefore you exist.
356000	358000	But what else do you truly know?
358000	364000	In the end, your brain is just interpreting signals from your senses and creating a world that you experience.
364000	367000	So technically, you could be just your brain that thinks the world is real.
367000	370000	And if we follow the logic of the Ink in the Universe class,
370000	374000	in particular, you could be a disembodied brain that, just by chance,
374000	378000	emerged in a dead universe with your complete set of knowledge and memories.
378000	380000	This is a pretty bizarre idea.
380000	383000	But if we do the maths, it's kind of pretty solid.
383000	386000	Let's compare the number of brains inside bodies in a living universe
386000	389000	with the number of naked brains in a dead universe.
389000	394000	Let's go really big and imagine that a total of 100 quadrillion humans will live around Earth.
394000	398000	And that the same amount of people will live around every star in the universe.
398000	403000	If we add this together, we get about 10 to the power of 41 brains inside bodies that will exist.
403000	409000	However, in a dead universe that has had enough time to explore all possible fluctuations and that will exist forever,
409000	413000	the number of naked brains that would emerge is, well, infinite.
413000	420000	So the probability that you're a floating brain is not only vastly larger than the probability that you're a real human,
420000	425000	it's so inconceivably larger that we can't even meaningfully quantify the difference.
425000	428000	How do you compare a number to infinity?
428000	432000	So, are you a floating brain that exists for one moment in time,
432000	436000	then basically forever passes, and then you exist for another moment in time?
436000	438000	Maybe not even in that order.
438000	442000	Maybe your life happens backwards and you just don't notice.
442000	445000	Maybe you've lived trillions of times already.
445000	448000	Are you the dream of a dead universe?
449000	452000	Really? Like, really?
452000	454000	Well, probably not.
454000	457000	First of all, there are a few loopholes.
457000	463000	For example, dark energy could behave completely differently from what we think today and lead us to another future.
463000	469000	Or maybe our dead universe will be too motionless to allow the creation of brains even with infinite time.
469000	472000	Or maybe the universe will end up dying in another way.
472000	478000	Our understanding of the cosmos doesn't have a solid enough foundation for anyone to worry if they're real or not.
478000	481000	Loopholes aside, if you were a fluctuating brain,
481000	487000	all the laws of physics stored in your brain would have originated at random and shouldn't bear any relation to the real world.
487000	491000	But we just used those laws to prove that you're a floating brain.
491000	494000	So even if you believe that you are a floating brain,
494000	498000	you'd have to admit that you have no good reason to believe that you are actually a floating brain.
499000	504000	Okay, so this hallucinatory trip might teach us something about our theories about the universe.
504000	509000	But in the end, it's just a really weird exercise in what you can do with physics.
509000	513000	An exercise of what brains and bodies are able to think about.
513000	516000	So don't worry, you're not a dream of the dead universe.
516000	518000	Probably.
