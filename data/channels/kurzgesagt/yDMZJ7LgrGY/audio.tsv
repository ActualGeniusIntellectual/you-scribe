0	2320	Hey you, so nice of you to join us.
2320	6000	We want to tell you about something that changed Kurzgesagt forever.
6000	9840	Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale passion project,
9840	13080	but creating animated science videos that are free for everyone
13080	16120	doesn't pay the bills. Damn you, reality.
16120	20120	In order to make ends meet, we had to take on real jobs during the day
20120	23440	and create Kurzgesagt videos at night. It was tough,
23440	27160	but our dream of inspiring people all around the world kept us going.
27600	30920	Then, in 2016, everything changed.
30920	33800	Kurzgesagt's founder, Philip Detmer, had an idea.
33800	38400	He wanted to create something inspiring that would extend beyond the digital YouTube cosmos.
38400	40280	Something tangible.
40280	43080	Something that would represent Kurzgesagt's view of the world
43080	47280	and our belief in humanity's potential for greatness.
47280	50880	His idea, the Kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar.
50880	55320	It establishes a New Year's Hero to include all people and cultures around the world.
55360	58080	This New Year's Hero, roughly 12,000 years ago,
58080	62040	signifies a time when humans first started working together on a larger scale,
62040	66880	laying the foundation for modern society and, eventually, our future ahead of us.
66880	69440	The first Human Era Calendar was a huge success.
69440	73800	It sold out within a few hours and inspired thousands of burbs around the globe.
73800	77400	Every year since then, we've created a new edition of the Human Era Calendar,
77400	80840	each one more spectacular and successful than the last.
80840	85200	It has enabled us to grow our team, improve our video quality and research standards,
85200	88200	and still release our videos for free for everyone.
88200	90880	This year's calendar is extra special.
90880	94000	Join us as we conduct a series of space experiments
94000	96680	to see how they would affect the development of life.
96680	99400	What would a creature living near an orange dwarf look like?
99400	102480	Could life still exist after a supernova explosion?
102480	104640	And what the hell is this?
104640	108040	Join us in 12,024 and find out.
108040	113040	And, of course, you can also use it to plan humanity's next steps towards greatness.
113080	116320	To celebrate what may be our most glorious calendar yet,
116320	119400	we've prepared a few spectacular limited deals for you.
119400	121960	Thank you so much for being a part of our story
121960	125320	and for coming together every year to make all of this possible.
