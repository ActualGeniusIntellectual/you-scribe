00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Hey you, so nice of you to join us.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,000
We want to tell you about something that changed Kurzgesagt forever.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale passion project,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,080
but creating animated science videos that are free for everyone

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,120
doesn't pay the bills. Damn you, reality.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,120
In order to make ends meet, we had to take on real jobs during the day

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,440
and create Kurzgesagt videos at night. It was tough,

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,160
but our dream of inspiring people all around the world kept us going.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,920
Then, in 2016, everything changed.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,800
Kurzgesagt's founder, Philip Detmer, had an idea.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,400
He wanted to create something inspiring that would extend beyond the digital YouTube cosmos.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,280
Something tangible.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,080
Something that would represent Kurzgesagt's view of the world

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,280
and our belief in humanity's potential for greatness.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,880
His idea, the Kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,320
It establishes a New Year's Hero to include all people and cultures around the world.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,080
This New Year's Hero, roughly 12,000 years ago,

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,040
signifies a time when humans first started working together on a larger scale,

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,880
laying the foundation for modern society and, eventually, our future ahead of us.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,440
The first Human Era Calendar was a huge success.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,800
It sold out within a few hours and inspired thousands of burbs around the globe.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,400
Every year since then, we've created a new edition of the Human Era Calendar,

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,840
each one more spectacular and successful than the last.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,200
It has enabled us to grow our team, improve our video quality and research standards,

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
and still release our videos for free for everyone.

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,880
This year's calendar is extra special.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
Join us as we conduct a series of space experiments

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,680
to see how they would affect the development of life.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,400
What would a creature living near an orange dwarf look like?

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,480
Could life still exist after a supernova explosion?

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,640
And what the hell is this?

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,040
Join us in 12,024 and find out.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,040
And, of course, you can also use it to plan humanity's next steps towards greatness.

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,320
To celebrate what may be our most glorious calendar yet,

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,400
we've prepared a few spectacular limited deals for you.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,960
Thank you so much for being a part of our story

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,320
and for coming together every year to make all of this possible.
