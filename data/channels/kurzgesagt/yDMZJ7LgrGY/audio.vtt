00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Hey you, so nice of you to join us.

00:02.320 --> 00:06.000
We want to tell you about something that changed Kurzgesagt forever.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.840
Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale passion project,

00:09.840 --> 00:13.080
but creating animated science videos that are free for everyone

00:13.080 --> 00:16.120
doesn't pay the bills. Damn you, reality.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.120
In order to make ends meet, we had to take on real jobs during the day

00:20.120 --> 00:23.440
and create Kurzgesagt videos at night. It was tough,

00:23.440 --> 00:27.160
but our dream of inspiring people all around the world kept us going.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.920
Then, in 2016, everything changed.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.800
Kurzgesagt's founder, Philip Detmer, had an idea.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.400
He wanted to create something inspiring that would extend beyond the digital YouTube cosmos.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.280
Something tangible.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.080
Something that would represent Kurzgesagt's view of the world

00:43.080 --> 00:47.280
and our belief in humanity's potential for greatness.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.880
His idea, the Kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.320
It establishes a New Year's Hero to include all people and cultures around the world.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.080
This New Year's Hero, roughly 12,000 years ago,

00:58.080 --> 01:02.040
signifies a time when humans first started working together on a larger scale,

01:02.040 --> 01:06.880
laying the foundation for modern society and, eventually, our future ahead of us.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.440
The first Human Era Calendar was a huge success.

01:09.440 --> 01:13.800
It sold out within a few hours and inspired thousands of burbs around the globe.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.400
Every year since then, we've created a new edition of the Human Era Calendar,

01:17.400 --> 01:20.840
each one more spectacular and successful than the last.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.200
It has enabled us to grow our team, improve our video quality and research standards,

01:25.200 --> 01:28.200
and still release our videos for free for everyone.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.880
This year's calendar is extra special.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.000
Join us as we conduct a series of space experiments

01:34.000 --> 01:36.680
to see how they would affect the development of life.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.400
What would a creature living near an orange dwarf look like?

01:39.400 --> 01:42.480
Could life still exist after a supernova explosion?

01:42.480 --> 01:44.640
And what the hell is this?

01:44.640 --> 01:48.040
Join us in 12,024 and find out.

01:48.040 --> 01:53.040
And, of course, you can also use it to plan humanity's next steps towards greatness.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.320
To celebrate what may be our most glorious calendar yet,

01:56.320 --> 01:59.400
we've prepared a few spectacular limited deals for you.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.960
Thank you so much for being a part of our story

02:01.960 --> 02:05.320
and for coming together every year to make all of this possible.
