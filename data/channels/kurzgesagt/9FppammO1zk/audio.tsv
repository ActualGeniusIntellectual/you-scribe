0	4000	A breathtaking scientific revolution is taking place.
4000	7500	Biotechnology has been progressing at stunning speed,
7500	11500	giving us the tools to eventually gain control over biology.
11500	14500	On the one hand, solving the deadliest diseases,
14500	18500	while also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs,
18500	21000	able to devastate humanity.
21000	22500	What's going on?
25500	28500	Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere.
28500	32500	The cotton in your clothes, the vegetables you eat, your dog.
32500	35000	Humans manipulate living things.
35000	39500	We use bacteria to produce insulin, connect prosthetics directly with our brains,
39500	43000	and make industrial enzymes to produce paper.
43000	47000	Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable diseases,
47000	51000	while we're working on food crops resistant to climate change.
51000	54500	Our mastery over biology has been speeding up so much,
54500	57500	that within weeks of the first COVID-19 case,
57500	61500	the unknown coronavirus was broken down in laboratories and analyzed.
61500	64500	Scientists generated a copy of its genetic material
64500	69000	to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began.
69000	72500	Something unthinkable a decade ago.
72500	75500	Where is all this sudden progress coming from?
75500	77500	Well, it's complicated.
77500	81000	But in a nutshell, really expensive things got cheap,
81000	85000	and knowledge of how to do impressive things spread freely.
85000	88000	The Human Genome Project, starting in 1990,
88000	92000	was the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety.
92000	96000	Thirteen years and three billion dollars later, it was complete.
96000	101500	By then, the cost of decoding a human genome had fallen to about one hundred million dollars.
101500	107000	Today, it's one hundred thousand times cheaper, costing only about a thousand dollars.
107000	108500	How is that possible?
108500	112000	Converting DNA into computer data and then studying it
112000	114000	used to be a super tedious process,
114000	118000	taking expert humans around three years of manual work.
118000	123000	Today, it takes about two weeks and is almost completely automated.
123000	127500	Biotechnology has gone from something restricted to the best and well-funded laboratories,
127500	129500	staffed by the world's top experts,
129500	134000	to something affordable enough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on.
134000	136000	What sped up the process even more,
136000	139500	is that information in the field is shared widely and freely.
139500	144000	Cutting-edge discoveries now take just about a year to be copied in laboratories around the world,
144000	147000	a few years for anyone with a biology background to work out,
147000	151500	and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with them in schools.
151500	155500	Imagine that your local computer repair shop could build a pristine iPhone 11
155500	157500	with just the parts lying around,
157500	161000	and that teenagers are asked to build a new iPhone 5 for homework.
161000	164000	Not a crappy homemade version, the real thing.
164000	169000	This is what's going on right now in biotechnology, a true revolution.
169000	174500	We are adding knowledge at unprecedented rates, while things get ever faster and cheaper to do.
174500	179000	This speed means we can expect even more wonderful things for humanity.
179000	185000	Lifesaving treatments, miracle crops, and solutions to problems we can't even imagine right now.
185000	188500	But unfortunately, progress cuts both ways.
188500	194500	What can be used for good, can also be used for bad, by accident or on purpose.
194500	198000	What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?
198500	204500	For all the good biotech will do for us, in the near future it also could easily kill many millions of people,
204500	207000	in the worst case, hundreds of millions.
207000	209000	Worse than any nuclear bomb.
209000	213000	The world just witnessed how fast the novel coronavirus spread.
213000	215500	We still don't know for sure if it came from nature,
215500	219500	or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with coronaviruses,
219500	222000	that's still subject to scientific debate.
222000	225500	In the end, at least 7 million people died.
225500	231500	And this was still a relatively mild virus, that didn't cause serious disease in most of those infected.
231500	233500	But that might change in the future.
233500	238500	Wherever the last pandemic came from, the next one might very well be our own fault.
238500	242500	In a sense, many things going on in biotechnology could lead to this.
242500	246500	Most of all, how easy it is to work with dangerous viruses.
246500	253000	Thousands of scientists can simply order the genetic data of infectious virus samples online, to experiment with them.
253000	260000	Sampling these into an artificial virus in 2023, costs about as much as a new car, including all the lab equipment.
260000	267000	At the same time, other scientists are trying to find viruses that hide in nature, like in wild bats or monkeys.
267000	270500	There are probably plenty of potentially deadly pandemics out there.
270500	273000	Virus hunters take samples back to the lab,
273000	278500	to learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans, and catalogue the danger.
278500	283500	When a biologist discovers a new virus, they usually publish its genetic data to the public.
283500	288000	Journals are eager to share descriptions of potentially dangerous viruses.
288000	292000	Other labs go further, and make viruses more dangerous.
292000	298500	They combine and mutate different viruses, to understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans,
298500	301000	or make them deadlier than their original forms.
301000	304000	And again, these results are shared freely.
304000	311500	All while synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild these viruses, are sold online to anyone, without any or very little tracking.
311500	318000	As the tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper and easy to use, and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying,
318000	324000	it's only a matter of time before a well-meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomb of viruses,
324000	328500	a superbug that will cause millions of deaths, and someone uses it.
328500	333000	Maybe because they have bad intentions, maybe because they're irresponsible or sloppy.
333000	339500	We're creating an environment in which it's increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized virus in their backyard.
339500	341500	This is scary.
341500	346500	The world would be plunged into an unending crisis, as new pandemics pop up year after year,
346500	353000	or all at once, killing large parts of the world's population, doing unimaginable damage to civilization as a whole,
353000	356500	and possibly undoing centuries of progress.
356500	360000	What can we do? Turns out, a lot.
360000	364500	It's not the first time we've faced a challenge like this, and we are not helpless.
364500	371000	Think of nuclear technology. Something extremely powerful and dangerous, with huge upsides and downsides.
371000	377500	Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs, so its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused.
377500	384500	From the very beginning, it was clear that knowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost care.
384500	389000	So, a lot of effort has gone into making sure no radioactive material disappears from sight,
389000	393500	or that countries don't try to hide weapons development behind energy programs.
393500	401000	The result hasn't been perfect, but considering the 411 nuclear power stations running today, we've been very successful.
401000	408000	Likewise, no researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb-making machines on the internet.
408000	413500	There's no reason we couldn't handle the really dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way.
413500	417000	Experts have come up with three sort of bullet points.
417000	423000	First, we need to delay the next deadly pandemic by getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses.
423000	431000	Their genetic data should be treated as an info hazard. Information that poses a danger to society if it's shared without care.
431000	435000	In other words, not just anyone should be able to order dangerous DNA online.
435000	442000	And if you do, you should be tracked, so it becomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff.
442000	450000	The next step is detecting the danger, by becoming aware which viruses are present among us and are spreading explosively between humans.
450000	457500	This could be as easy as having labs in population centers maintain virus detectors that monitor what's going on in the micro world.
457500	465000	If we suddenly see certain microorganisms show up a lot in a short time, we can react quickly and start countermeasures.
465000	468000	Which is the final step, destroy.
468000	474000	We basically need to build a machine that's ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over.
474000	480500	We can do this with new tools that are being developed right now, like nano filters that pull dangers out of the air we breathe,
480500	486500	or specialized UV lamps that just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person to person.
486500	491500	And of course, we need to get better at getting new vaccines faster than ever before in history.
491500	497500	If we do these three things, the chances are really good that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future.
498000	505000	Biotechnology, like any exciting and powerful technology, is neither inherently good or bad.
505000	508500	It has the potential to be both in breathtaking ways.
508500	513000	We have the chance to have a future where we get to truly control biology.
513000	519000	Our biology, the biology of the plants and animals around us, and the biology of the micro world.
519000	526000	So let's use it to create a future where we triumph over pandemics and diseases for good.

545500	549000	Aside from BioRisk, there are more guides to check out, too.
549000	553500	Let's tell you about one of the most embarrassing moments in Kurzgesagt history.
553500	555000	It's a pretty great story.
555000	559500	A few years ago, we posted an image of a fake evolutionary tree on social media,
559500	562500	just to post something nice without thinking about it.
562500	565000	But we messed with the wrong verbs.
565000	571000	Immediately, we got thousands of messages from you telling us how wrong it was, unscientific, bad.
571000	575000	We underestimated that you take everything that we put out into the world seriously,
575000	579000	and you set high standards for our research and fact-checking process.
579000	582500	This hurt, a lot. We wanted to be better than that.
582500	588000	So we deleted it and contacted experts and spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration,
588000	593500	and developed a new visualization of the relationships between species that didn't exist before.
593500	598000	A map of evolution you can use to figure out how closely you're related to a flying lemur.
598000	599500	Expert approved.
599500	605000	We were extremely proud of the result, and since we'd spent so much time on it, we turned it into a poster.
605000	607500	And from that, a new vision was born.
607500	611500	We wanted to become the best infographic and science poster shop in the world.
611500	616000	Today, we've designed almost 100 posters and sold over half a million copies.
616000	620500	Every single one made with love, care, and lots of attention to detail.
620500	623000	All because you guys challenged us.
623000	629000	Thank you so much for that, and for supporting our weird ideas and our sometimes weird merch.
629000	632500	Because of you, we can continue to release our videos for free for everyone,
632500	638000	and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts to spark curiosity in people all around the world.
638000	641000	Thank you so, so much for being part of our vision.
641000	644500	We literally couldn't do it without you.
