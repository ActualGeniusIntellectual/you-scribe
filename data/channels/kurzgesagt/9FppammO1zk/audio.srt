1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A breathtaking scientific revolution is taking place.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Biotechnology has been progressing at stunning speed,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
giving us the tools to eventually gain control over biology.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
On the one hand, solving the deadliest diseases,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
while also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs,

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
able to devastate humanity.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,500
What's going on?

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The cotton in your clothes, the vegetables you eat, your dog.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Humans manipulate living things.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,500
We use bacteria to produce insulin, connect prosthetics directly with our brains,

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,000
and make industrial enzymes to produce paper.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable diseases,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
while we're working on food crops resistant to climate change.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Our mastery over biology has been speeding up so much,

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
that within weeks of the first COVID-19 case,

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
the unknown coronavirus was broken down in laboratories and analyzed.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Scientists generated a copy of its genetic material

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,000
to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Something unthinkable a decade ago.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Where is all this sudden progress coming from?

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Well, it's complicated.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
But in a nutshell, really expensive things got cheap,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and knowledge of how to do impressive things spread freely.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Human Genome Project, starting in 1990,

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
was the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thirteen years and three billion dollars later, it was complete.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,500
By then, the cost of decoding a human genome had fallen to about one hundred million dollars.

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,000
Today, it's one hundred thousand times cheaper, costing only about a thousand dollars.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,500
How is that possible?

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Converting DNA into computer data and then studying it

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
used to be a super tedious process,

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
taking expert humans around three years of manual work.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Today, it takes about two weeks and is almost completely automated.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Biotechnology has gone from something restricted to the best and well-funded laboratories,

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
staffed by the world's top experts,

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,000
to something affordable enough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What sped up the process even more,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,500
is that information in the field is shared widely and freely.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,000
Cutting-edge discoveries now take just about a year to be copied in laboratories around the world,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
a few years for anyone with a biology background to work out,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,500
and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with them in schools.

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Imagine that your local computer repair shop could build a pristine iPhone 11

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
with just the parts lying around,

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
and that teenagers are asked to build a new iPhone 5 for homework.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Not a crappy homemade version, the real thing.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is what's going on right now in biotechnology, a true revolution.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,500
We are adding knowledge at unprecedented rates, while things get ever faster and cheaper to do.

49
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,000
This speed means we can expect even more wonderful things for humanity.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Lifesaving treatments, miracle crops, and solutions to problems we can't even imagine right now.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,500
But unfortunately, progress cuts both ways.

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,500
What can be used for good, can also be used for bad, by accident or on purpose.

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,000
What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,500
For all the good biotech will do for us, in the near future it also could easily kill many millions of people,

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
in the worst case, hundreds of millions.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Worse than any nuclear bomb.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The world just witnessed how fast the novel coronavirus spread.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500
We still don't know for sure if it came from nature,

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with coronaviruses,

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
that's still subject to scientific debate.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,500
In the end, at least 7 million people died.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,500
And this was still a relatively mild virus, that didn't cause serious disease in most of those infected.

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
But that might change in the future.

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Wherever the last pandemic came from, the next one might very well be our own fault.

65
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
In a sense, many things going on in biotechnology could lead to this.

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Most of all, how easy it is to work with dangerous viruses.

67
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Thousands of scientists can simply order the genetic data of infectious virus samples online, to experiment with them.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sampling these into an artificial virus in 2023, costs about as much as a new car, including all the lab equipment.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
At the same time, other scientists are trying to find viruses that hide in nature, like in wild bats or monkeys.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,500
There are probably plenty of potentially deadly pandemics out there.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
Virus hunters take samples back to the lab,

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,500
to learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans, and catalogue the danger.

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,500
When a biologist discovers a new virus, they usually publish its genetic data to the public.

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,000
Journals are eager to share descriptions of potentially dangerous viruses.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Other labs go further, and make viruses more dangerous.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,500
They combine and mutate different viruses, to understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans,

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,000
or make them deadlier than their original forms.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And again, these results are shared freely.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,500
All while synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild these viruses, are sold online to anyone, without any or very little tracking.

80
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,000
As the tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper and easy to use, and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying,

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
it's only a matter of time before a well-meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomb of viruses,

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,500
a superbug that will cause millions of deaths, and someone uses it.

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Maybe because they have bad intentions, maybe because they're irresponsible or sloppy.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,500
We're creating an environment in which it's increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized virus in their backyard.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
This is scary.

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,500
The world would be plunged into an unending crisis, as new pandemics pop up year after year,

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,000
or all at once, killing large parts of the world's population, doing unimaginable damage to civilization as a whole,

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,500
and possibly undoing centuries of progress.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,000
What can we do? Turns out, a lot.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
It's not the first time we've faced a challenge like this, and we are not helpless.

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,000
Think of nuclear technology. Something extremely powerful and dangerous, with huge upsides and downsides.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,500
Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs, so its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused.

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,500
From the very beginning, it was clear that knowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost care.

94
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,000
So, a lot of effort has gone into making sure no radioactive material disappears from sight,

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,500
or that countries don't try to hide weapons development behind energy programs.

96
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:41,000
The result hasn't been perfect, but considering the 411 nuclear power stations running today, we've been very successful.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Likewise, no researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb-making machines on the internet.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,500
There's no reason we couldn't handle the really dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
Experts have come up with three sort of bullet points.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
First, we need to delay the next deadly pandemic by getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Their genetic data should be treated as an info hazard. Information that poses a danger to society if it's shared without care.

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In other words, not just anyone should be able to order dangerous DNA online.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And if you do, you should be tracked, so it becomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The next step is detecting the danger, by becoming aware which viruses are present among us and are spreading explosively between humans.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,500
This could be as easy as having labs in population centers maintain virus detectors that monitor what's going on in the micro world.

106
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,000
If we suddenly see certain microorganisms show up a lot in a short time, we can react quickly and start countermeasures.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Which is the final step, destroy.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We basically need to build a machine that's ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,500
We can do this with new tools that are being developed right now, like nano filters that pull dangers out of the air we breathe,

110
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,500
or specialized UV lamps that just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person to person.

111
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
And of course, we need to get better at getting new vaccines faster than ever before in history.

112
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,500
If we do these three things, the chances are really good that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Biotechnology, like any exciting and powerful technology, is neither inherently good or bad.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,500
It has the potential to be both in breathtaking ways.

115
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,000
We have the chance to have a future where we get to truly control biology.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Our biology, the biology of the plants and animals around us, and the biology of the micro world.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So let's use it to create a future where we triumph over pandemics and diseases for good.

118
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,000

a non-profit organization that helps people find careers that can tackle some of humanity's greatest problems in the most efficient way.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,500
We put a link and further reading in the description and sources.

122
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Aside from BioRisk, there are more guides to check out, too.

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,500
Let's tell you about one of the most embarrassing moments in Kurzgesagt history.

124
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a pretty great story.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,500
A few years ago, we posted an image of a fake evolutionary tree on social media,

126
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
just to post something nice without thinking about it.

127
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,000
But we messed with the wrong verbs.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Immediately, we got thousands of messages from you telling us how wrong it was, unscientific, bad.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We underestimated that you take everything that we put out into the world seriously,

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and you set high standards for our research and fact-checking process.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,500
This hurt, a lot. We wanted to be better than that.

132
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,000
So we deleted it and contacted experts and spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration,

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,500
and developed a new visualization of the relationships between species that didn't exist before.

134
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,000
A map of evolution you can use to figure out how closely you're related to a flying lemur.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Expert approved.

136
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,000
We were extremely proud of the result, and since we'd spent so much time on it, we turned it into a poster.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,500
And from that, a new vision was born.

138
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,500
We wanted to become the best infographic and science poster shop in the world.

139
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,000
Today, we've designed almost 100 posters and sold over half a million copies.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Every single one made with love, care, and lots of attention to detail.

141
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,000
All because you guys challenged us.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you so much for that, and for supporting our weird ideas and our sometimes weird merch.

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Because of you, we can continue to release our videos for free for everyone,

144
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,000
and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts to spark curiosity in people all around the world.

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you so, so much for being part of our vision.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,500
We literally couldn't do it without you.
