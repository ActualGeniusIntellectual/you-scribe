00:00.000 --> 00:06.020
In 2022, nearly half of Americans expected a civil war in the next few years.

00:06.020 --> 00:10.080
One in five now believes political violence is justified.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.900
And it's not just the US, but around the world.

00:12.900 --> 00:16.500
People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.520
There are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot, social media.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.440
Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.560
It riles us up or sucks us into doomstrolling, making us stressed and depressed.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.580
It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world.

00:34.580 --> 00:39.720
New research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.560
It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains

00:44.560 --> 00:47.640
work, but not in the way you think.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.160
The myth of the filter bubble.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.080
You've probably heard about online filter bubbles.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.800
Filters give you exactly what you want or what they think you want.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.200
You only see information that shows you opinions that agree with yours, while dissenting opinions

01:01.200 --> 01:03.720
or information are filtered out.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.960
Since you only see content close to your world view, more extreme and toxic opinions suddenly

01:08.960 --> 01:11.000
seem less extreme.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.480
You're trapped in a radicalizing filter bubble and your view of the world becomes narrower

01:15.480 --> 01:17.720
and more extreme.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.680
But is that true?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.840
Extreme filter bubbles seem to be rather rare.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.520
Users that investigated what people actually look at online or are shown by search engines

01:27.520 --> 01:30.980
found little evidence that you're ideologically isolated.

01:30.980 --> 01:32.860
It's the exact opposite.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.360
Online you are constantly confronted with opinions and world views that are not your

01:36.360 --> 01:37.440
own.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.480
It turns out that the place where you are the most ideologically isolated is your real

01:41.480 --> 01:45.220
life, in the real world, with real people.

01:45.220 --> 01:48.960
Your real world interactions with your friends, family, colleagues and neighbors are much

01:48.960 --> 01:51.720
less diverse than your online bubble.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.920
The filter bubble exists in your real life, not online.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.960
Okay, wait.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.960
Online filter bubbles have been the prevailing explanation as to why we've all started hating

02:01.960 --> 02:04.640
each other more over the last two decades.

02:04.640 --> 02:09.200
If that's not the case, shouldn't the internet open our minds and make us more empathetic

02:09.200 --> 02:10.640
with each other?

02:10.640 --> 02:14.160
Unfortunately, your brain is stupid.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.400
Your brain is stupid.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.480
Human brains didn't evolve to understand the true nature of reality, but to navigate and

02:21.480 --> 02:24.320
maintain social structures.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.000
Our ancestors desperately needed each other to survive, so our brains had to make sure

02:29.000 --> 02:30.920
we cooperate it.

02:30.920 --> 02:35.920
That's why social isolation or exclusion feels so horrible, because it was actually life

02:35.920 --> 02:36.920
threatening.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.600
A tribe that worked together survived.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.480
A divided tribe died.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.720
The way communities worked for thousands of years is that, sure, you may have disliked

02:46.720 --> 02:50.480
a neighbor, but because you lived close to each other, you also rooted for the same sports

02:50.480 --> 02:52.720
club or saw them at church.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.800
You both thought that the people from the other village were idiots.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.400
Being physically close made you familiar and created similarities that bridged the gap

03:01.400 --> 03:05.120
of different world views so you didn't murder each other.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.840
And your world view was probably not that different in the first place because it was

03:08.840 --> 03:11.960
formed by the same local culture.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.320
When our brains evolved, this was enough.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.880
Whoever was around was similar to us.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.140
We liked what was similar to us.

03:19.140 --> 03:23.500
This kept us aligned enough to work together despite our differences.

03:23.500 --> 03:28.320
As humanity moved on from small tribes to towns and cities, from chiefdoms to kingdoms

03:28.320 --> 03:34.560
to nations, our brains and our communities had to adapt to more diverse sets of neighbors.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.700
We began to meet on the town square or in universities, where we argued and screamed

03:38.700 --> 03:39.700
at each other.

03:39.700 --> 03:43.800
But in the grand scheme of things, communities were still relatively isolated, we were still

03:43.800 --> 03:47.700
pretty similar and aligned with the people around us.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.820
Hate and disagreement are not a bad thing per se.

03:50.820 --> 03:54.780
Tension over how we should live can create new and wonderful things.

03:54.780 --> 04:00.260
Our values, norms and taboos are always evolving and whatever we think is normal today will

04:00.260 --> 04:02.240
not be normal in the future.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.900
But we also need social glue to hold our societies together because our brains don't care about

04:06.900 --> 04:11.060
the meta-level of humanity but about being safe in a tribe.

04:11.060 --> 04:16.180
Until about 20 years ago, we did something truly new that hit our brains like a freight

04:16.180 --> 04:21.100
train, the social media internet, the digital town square.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.480
Don't you dare disagree with me.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.940
Social sorting.

04:24.940 --> 04:29.600
In a nutshell, our brains are not able to process the amount of disagreement we encounter

04:29.600 --> 04:31.540
on the social internet.

04:31.540 --> 04:35.100
The very mechanisms that made it possible for our ancestors to work together in the

04:35.100 --> 04:39.620
first place are derailed in ways we were not prepared for.

04:39.620 --> 04:44.740
Whether you want it to or not, your brain sorts people by worldviews and opinions into

04:44.740 --> 04:45.740
teams.

04:45.940 --> 04:49.260
This is not simply tribalism, it goes further.

04:49.260 --> 04:52.500
Researchers have called this process social sorting.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.720
On the digital town square, you encounter people that express opinions or share information

04:56.720 --> 04:58.900
that clash with your worldview.

04:58.900 --> 05:02.460
But unlike your neighbour, they don't root for your local sports club.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.580
You're missing the local social glue your brain needs to align with them.

05:06.580 --> 05:13.260
For your brain, the disagreement between yourself and them becomes a central part of their identity.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.040
And this makes it less likely that you will seriously consider their position or opinion

05:17.040 --> 05:18.340
in the future.

05:18.340 --> 05:23.440
If you hear bad things about them, your brain is much more likely to believe it uncritically.

05:23.440 --> 05:27.820
On the flip side, there are people who share your worldview and are maybe even more similar

05:27.820 --> 05:32.380
to you than many people in your real life, which makes your brain like them a lot and

05:32.380 --> 05:34.660
kind of hyper-align with them.

05:34.660 --> 05:38.380
People who think like you are probably good people because you're a good person and

05:38.380 --> 05:41.420
whatever social group you belong to is good.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.220
So your brain is more likely to believe their opinions.

05:44.220 --> 05:49.940
If you hear bad things about them, your brain is much more likely to dismiss it uncritically.

05:49.940 --> 05:54.100
The engagement-driven social internet makes it worse because it wants to keep you online

05:54.100 --> 05:55.800
as long as possible.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.180
And the most engaging emotion is, unfortunately, anger.

06:00.180 --> 06:04.560
The more angry you get, the more likely you are to share and engage, and this leads to

06:04.560 --> 06:08.860
social media amplifying the most extreme and controversial opinions.

06:08.860 --> 06:14.100
It optimizes not only to show us disagreement, but the worst disagreement possible.

06:14.100 --> 06:18.820
And because your stupid brain is sorting people into teams, whatever the worst opinions are,

06:18.820 --> 06:22.780
it assigns the same opinions to everybody on the other team.

06:22.780 --> 06:27.220
What's striking and new about online polarization is that all the aspects of our lives that

06:27.220 --> 06:32.620
make us individuals, our lifestyle choices, the comedians or shows we watch, our religion,

06:32.620 --> 06:37.400
sense of fashion, and so on, are condensed, making it seem that they're parts of opposing

06:37.400 --> 06:40.260
and mutually exclusive identities.

06:40.260 --> 06:45.380
This simplifies and distorts disagreements about how we should run society so much that

06:45.380 --> 06:50.320
it often seems as if the people on the other team are actively, willfully making the world

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
worse.

06:51.320 --> 06:57.000
That they're almost evil, beyond convincing with rationality, facts, or civil discussion.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.100
While you are, of course, on the correct team, it may be hard to process that you may seem

07:01.100 --> 07:03.460
like that to people on the other team.

07:03.460 --> 07:09.100
On a societal level, this is dissolving the social glue that's the foundation of our democracies.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.260
If we think our neighbors are evil, how can we live together?

07:13.260 --> 07:17.480
This is especially bad in the US, where the two-party system makes it extra easy to think

07:17.480 --> 07:19.720
of people in terms of teams.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.500
Negative opinion about the other party has reached record highs.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.240
Okay, is there something we can learn from this?

07:27.240 --> 07:29.980
Is there something we can do?

07:29.980 --> 07:31.580
Something more positive.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.160
Opinion part.

07:33.160 --> 07:38.420
In the end, it's important to be aware of what social media does to your brain.

07:38.420 --> 07:42.840
It's easier to change yourself than to change the world, so you can self-examine why you

07:42.840 --> 07:47.760
believe the things you believe, and whether you dismiss or believe information based on

07:47.760 --> 07:51.460
who the person is who is stating that information.

07:51.460 --> 07:55.720
The internet comes with a lot of ups and downs, and just like we had to adapt from living

07:55.720 --> 08:00.380
in small tribes to living in cities, we need to adapt to the information age where we have

08:00.380 --> 08:03.240
access to billions of people.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.360
Evolution is too slow, so we need to find models that work with what our brains are

08:07.360 --> 08:09.620
able to tolerate.

08:09.620 --> 08:13.500
One model that seemed to work well was the pre-social media internet old people might

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
remember.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.400
Bulletin boards, forums, blogs.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.920
The main difference to today was twofold.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.000
For one, there were no algorithms fighting to keep you online at any cost.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.620
At some point, you were done with the internet for the day, as mind-blowing as this may sound.

08:29.860 --> 08:34.400
But more importantly, the old internet was very fractured, split into thousands of different

08:34.400 --> 08:39.200
communities, like small villages gathering around shared beliefs and interests.

08:39.200 --> 08:44.580
These villages were separated from each other by digital rivers or mountains.

08:44.580 --> 08:49.440
These communities worked because they mirrored real life much more than social media.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.320
Each village had its own culture and set of rules.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.780
Maybe one community was into rough humor and soft moderation, another had strict rules

08:56.780 --> 08:58.700
and banned easily.

08:58.700 --> 09:02.480
If you didn't play by the village rules, you'd be banned, or you could just go and

09:02.480 --> 09:05.240
move to another village that suited you better.

09:05.240 --> 09:09.520
So instead of all of us gathering in one place, overwhelming our brains at a town square that

09:09.520 --> 09:14.640
in the end just leads us to going insane, one solution to achieve less social sorting

09:14.640 --> 09:16.520
may be extremely simple.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.560
Go back to smaller online communities.

09:19.560 --> 09:25.080
Because what our stupid brains don't realize is that we are actually all on the same team.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.900
Humanity, on a wet rock, speeding through space in a universe that doesn't think about

09:29.900 --> 09:30.900
us.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.940
We are all in this together.

09:32.940 --> 09:37.660
But until our brains adjust to being able to deal with that, we might be better off

09:37.660 --> 09:39.900
being a tiny bit separated.

09:44.460 --> 09:48.100
One of the worst things about the media we consume is that most news organizations tend

09:48.100 --> 09:52.240
to cater to one team, making you feel you're on the correct side.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.520
Ground News, the sponsor of this video, is trying to make these biases more transparent

09:56.520 --> 10:01.300
by giving you tools that help you think critically about the information you consume, a mission

10:01.300 --> 10:03.540
we wholeheartedly support.

10:03.540 --> 10:07.680
Ground News gathers related articles from around the world in one place, so you can

10:07.680 --> 10:10.680
compare how different outlets and sides cover them.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.880
They provide context about the source of the information, if they have a political bias,

10:14.880 --> 10:17.900
how reliable their reporting is, and who owns them.

10:17.900 --> 10:22.640
This makes the news less stressful and makes you understand the world much better.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.400
literacy tools.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.560
Our favorite tool has a personal background.

10:39.560 --> 10:44.280
In 2018, Kurzgesagt founder Philipp, who wrote this video, was going through chemotherapy

10:44.280 --> 10:49.060
and was intensely bored, so he ended up reading all the big German newspapers, even the ones

10:49.060 --> 10:52.380
he hated front to back, every single day.

10:52.380 --> 10:56.900
Aside from the obvious biases, what was the most shocking were the stories each side did

10:56.900 --> 10:58.260
not talk about.

10:58.260 --> 11:02.520
Both sides ignored things that are inconvenient to their world views.

11:02.520 --> 11:07.960
The Ground News Blindspot feed highlights this exact thing, showing you news stories

11:07.960 --> 11:12.220
that are heavily covered by one side of the political spectrum and ignored by the other.

11:12.220 --> 11:17.280
