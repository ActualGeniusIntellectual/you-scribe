0	6020	In 2022, nearly half of Americans expected a civil war in the next few years.
6020	10080	One in five now believes political violence is justified.
10080	12900	And it's not just the US, but around the world.
12900	16500	People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.
16500	21520	There are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot, social media.
21520	25440	Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic.
25440	30560	It riles us up or sucks us into doomstrolling, making us stressed and depressed.
30560	34580	It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world.
34580	39720	New research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case.
39720	44560	It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains
44560	47640	work, but not in the way you think.
47640	50160	The myth of the filter bubble.
50160	53080	You've probably heard about online filter bubbles.
53080	56800	Filters give you exactly what you want or what they think you want.
56800	61200	You only see information that shows you opinions that agree with yours, while dissenting opinions
61200	63720	or information are filtered out.
63720	68960	Since you only see content close to your world view, more extreme and toxic opinions suddenly
68960	71000	seem less extreme.
71000	75480	You're trapped in a radicalizing filter bubble and your view of the world becomes narrower
75480	77720	and more extreme.
77720	79680	But is that true?
79680	82840	Extreme filter bubbles seem to be rather rare.
82840	87520	Users that investigated what people actually look at online or are shown by search engines
87520	90980	found little evidence that you're ideologically isolated.
90980	92860	It's the exact opposite.
92860	96360	Online you are constantly confronted with opinions and world views that are not your
96360	97440	own.
97440	101480	It turns out that the place where you are the most ideologically isolated is your real
101480	105220	life, in the real world, with real people.
105220	108960	Your real world interactions with your friends, family, colleagues and neighbors are much
108960	111720	less diverse than your online bubble.
111720	115920	The filter bubble exists in your real life, not online.
115920	117960	Okay, wait.
117960	121960	Online filter bubbles have been the prevailing explanation as to why we've all started hating
121960	124640	each other more over the last two decades.
124640	129200	If that's not the case, shouldn't the internet open our minds and make us more empathetic
129200	130640	with each other?
130640	134160	Unfortunately, your brain is stupid.
134160	136400	Your brain is stupid.
136400	141480	Human brains didn't evolve to understand the true nature of reality, but to navigate and
141480	144320	maintain social structures.
144320	149000	Our ancestors desperately needed each other to survive, so our brains had to make sure
149000	150920	we cooperate it.
150920	155920	That's why social isolation or exclusion feels so horrible, because it was actually life
155920	156920	threatening.
156920	159600	A tribe that worked together survived.
159600	162480	A divided tribe died.
162480	166720	The way communities worked for thousands of years is that, sure, you may have disliked
166720	170480	a neighbor, but because you lived close to each other, you also rooted for the same sports
170480	172720	club or saw them at church.
172720	176800	You both thought that the people from the other village were idiots.
176800	181400	Being physically close made you familiar and created similarities that bridged the gap
181400	185120	of different world views so you didn't murder each other.
185120	188840	And your world view was probably not that different in the first place because it was
188840	191960	formed by the same local culture.
191960	194320	When our brains evolved, this was enough.
194320	196880	Whoever was around was similar to us.
196880	199140	We liked what was similar to us.
199140	203500	This kept us aligned enough to work together despite our differences.
203500	208320	As humanity moved on from small tribes to towns and cities, from chiefdoms to kingdoms
208320	214560	to nations, our brains and our communities had to adapt to more diverse sets of neighbors.
214560	218700	We began to meet on the town square or in universities, where we argued and screamed
218700	219700	at each other.
219700	223800	But in the grand scheme of things, communities were still relatively isolated, we were still
223800	227700	pretty similar and aligned with the people around us.
227740	230820	Hate and disagreement are not a bad thing per se.
230820	234780	Tension over how we should live can create new and wonderful things.
234780	240260	Our values, norms and taboos are always evolving and whatever we think is normal today will
240260	242240	not be normal in the future.
242240	246900	But we also need social glue to hold our societies together because our brains don't care about
246900	251060	the meta-level of humanity but about being safe in a tribe.
251060	256180	Until about 20 years ago, we did something truly new that hit our brains like a freight
256180	261100	train, the social media internet, the digital town square.
261100	263480	Don't you dare disagree with me.
263480	264940	Social sorting.
264940	269600	In a nutshell, our brains are not able to process the amount of disagreement we encounter
269600	271540	on the social internet.
271540	275100	The very mechanisms that made it possible for our ancestors to work together in the
275100	279620	first place are derailed in ways we were not prepared for.
279620	284740	Whether you want it to or not, your brain sorts people by worldviews and opinions into
284740	285740	teams.
285940	289260	This is not simply tribalism, it goes further.
289260	292500	Researchers have called this process social sorting.
292500	296720	On the digital town square, you encounter people that express opinions or share information
296720	298900	that clash with your worldview.
298900	302460	But unlike your neighbour, they don't root for your local sports club.
302460	306580	You're missing the local social glue your brain needs to align with them.
306580	313260	For your brain, the disagreement between yourself and them becomes a central part of their identity.
313400	317040	And this makes it less likely that you will seriously consider their position or opinion
317040	318340	in the future.
318340	323440	If you hear bad things about them, your brain is much more likely to believe it uncritically.
323440	327820	On the flip side, there are people who share your worldview and are maybe even more similar
327820	332380	to you than many people in your real life, which makes your brain like them a lot and
332380	334660	kind of hyper-align with them.
334660	338380	People who think like you are probably good people because you're a good person and
338380	341420	whatever social group you belong to is good.
341420	344220	So your brain is more likely to believe their opinions.
344220	349940	If you hear bad things about them, your brain is much more likely to dismiss it uncritically.
349940	354100	The engagement-driven social internet makes it worse because it wants to keep you online
354100	355800	as long as possible.
355800	360180	And the most engaging emotion is, unfortunately, anger.
360180	364560	The more angry you get, the more likely you are to share and engage, and this leads to
364560	368860	social media amplifying the most extreme and controversial opinions.
368860	374100	It optimizes not only to show us disagreement, but the worst disagreement possible.
374100	378820	And because your stupid brain is sorting people into teams, whatever the worst opinions are,
378820	382780	it assigns the same opinions to everybody on the other team.
382780	387220	What's striking and new about online polarization is that all the aspects of our lives that
387220	392620	make us individuals, our lifestyle choices, the comedians or shows we watch, our religion,
392620	397400	sense of fashion, and so on, are condensed, making it seem that they're parts of opposing
397400	400260	and mutually exclusive identities.
400260	405380	This simplifies and distorts disagreements about how we should run society so much that
405380	410320	it often seems as if the people on the other team are actively, willfully making the world
410320	411320	worse.
411320	417000	That they're almost evil, beyond convincing with rationality, facts, or civil discussion.
417000	421100	While you are, of course, on the correct team, it may be hard to process that you may seem
421100	423460	like that to people on the other team.
423460	429100	On a societal level, this is dissolving the social glue that's the foundation of our democracies.
429100	433260	If we think our neighbors are evil, how can we live together?
433260	437480	This is especially bad in the US, where the two-party system makes it extra easy to think
437480	439720	of people in terms of teams.
439720	443500	Negative opinion about the other party has reached record highs.
443500	447240	Okay, is there something we can learn from this?
447240	449980	Is there something we can do?
449980	451580	Something more positive.
451580	453160	Opinion part.
453160	458420	In the end, it's important to be aware of what social media does to your brain.
458420	462840	It's easier to change yourself than to change the world, so you can self-examine why you
462840	467760	believe the things you believe, and whether you dismiss or believe information based on
467760	471460	who the person is who is stating that information.
471460	475720	The internet comes with a lot of ups and downs, and just like we had to adapt from living
475720	480380	in small tribes to living in cities, we need to adapt to the information age where we have
480380	483240	access to billions of people.
483240	487360	Evolution is too slow, so we need to find models that work with what our brains are
487360	489620	able to tolerate.
489620	493500	One model that seemed to work well was the pre-social media internet old people might
493500	494500	remember.
494500	497400	Bulletin boards, forums, blogs.
497400	499920	The main difference to today was twofold.
499920	504000	For one, there were no algorithms fighting to keep you online at any cost.
504000	509620	At some point, you were done with the internet for the day, as mind-blowing as this may sound.
509860	514400	But more importantly, the old internet was very fractured, split into thousands of different
514400	519200	communities, like small villages gathering around shared beliefs and interests.
519200	524580	These villages were separated from each other by digital rivers or mountains.
524580	529440	These communities worked because they mirrored real life much more than social media.
529440	532320	Each village had its own culture and set of rules.
532320	536780	Maybe one community was into rough humor and soft moderation, another had strict rules
536780	538700	and banned easily.
538700	542480	If you didn't play by the village rules, you'd be banned, or you could just go and
542480	545240	move to another village that suited you better.
545240	549520	So instead of all of us gathering in one place, overwhelming our brains at a town square that
549520	554640	in the end just leads us to going insane, one solution to achieve less social sorting
554640	556520	may be extremely simple.
556520	559560	Go back to smaller online communities.
559560	565080	Because what our stupid brains don't realize is that we are actually all on the same team.
565080	569900	Humanity, on a wet rock, speeding through space in a universe that doesn't think about
569900	570900	us.
570900	572940	We are all in this together.
572940	577660	But until our brains adjust to being able to deal with that, we might be better off
577660	579900	being a tiny bit separated.
584460	588100	One of the worst things about the media we consume is that most news organizations tend
588100	592240	to cater to one team, making you feel you're on the correct side.
592240	596520	Ground News, the sponsor of this video, is trying to make these biases more transparent
596520	601300	by giving you tools that help you think critically about the information you consume, a mission
601300	603540	we wholeheartedly support.
603540	607680	Ground News gathers related articles from around the world in one place, so you can
607680	610680	compare how different outlets and sides cover them.
610680	614880	They provide context about the source of the information, if they have a political bias,
614880	617900	how reliable their reporting is, and who owns them.
617900	622640	This makes the news less stressful and makes you understand the world much better.

635720	637400	literacy tools.
637400	639560	Our favorite tool has a personal background.
639560	644280	In 2018, Kurzgesagt founder Philipp, who wrote this video, was going through chemotherapy
644280	649060	and was intensely bored, so he ended up reading all the big German newspapers, even the ones
649060	652380	he hated front to back, every single day.
652380	656900	Aside from the obvious biases, what was the most shocking were the stories each side did
656900	658260	not talk about.
658260	662520	Both sides ignored things that are inconvenient to their world views.
662520	667960	The Ground News Blindspot feed highlights this exact thing, showing you news stories
667960	672220	that are heavily covered by one side of the political spectrum and ignored by the other.
672220	677280	So check them out at ground.news.nutshell to make sure you're seeing the full picture.
