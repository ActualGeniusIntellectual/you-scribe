00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
Earth as a cube. What would it look like?

00:02.800 --> 00:07.600
You start somewhere that looks pretty familiar, except the landscape looks flat in every direction.

00:07.600 --> 00:12.300
Let's go. You start walking. Soon it feels like you're climbing. That's weird.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.100
You can look straight back at where you started, but it's getting harder to keep going.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.700
After a few days, you know you're on a mountain so giant you can't see its edges.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.400
The air is thin and cold. How much further?

00:24.400 --> 00:29.300
You've been climbing for weeks now. You've ascended past the atmosphere and need a suit to keep going.

00:29.300 --> 00:35.100
At some point, the climbing started to become easier. You're so high up that gravity is very weak.

00:35.100 --> 00:38.200
One more step and you've reached the top.

00:38.200 --> 00:42.400
It's the corner of a cube that's 10,300 kilometers wide.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.600
Because of its weird gravity, the oceans take the shape of a giant dome in the middle of each face.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.900
Sadly, this view won't last for long.

00:49.900 --> 00:55.100
Rocks aren't strong enough to hold this shape, so the planet would eventually collapse into a regular sphere.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.200
But for now, let's admire.
