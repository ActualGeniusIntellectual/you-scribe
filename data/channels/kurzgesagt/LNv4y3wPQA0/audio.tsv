0	2800	Earth as a cube. What would it look like?
2800	7600	You start somewhere that looks pretty familiar, except the landscape looks flat in every direction.
7600	12300	Let's go. You start walking. Soon it feels like you're climbing. That's weird.
12300	16100	You can look straight back at where you started, but it's getting harder to keep going.
16100	20700	After a few days, you know you're on a mountain so giant you can't see its edges.
20700	24400	The air is thin and cold. How much further?
24400	29300	You've been climbing for weeks now. You've ascended past the atmosphere and need a suit to keep going.
29300	35100	At some point, the climbing started to become easier. You're so high up that gravity is very weak.
35100	38200	One more step and you've reached the top.
38200	42400	It's the corner of a cube that's 10,300 kilometers wide.
42400	47600	Because of its weird gravity, the oceans take the shape of a giant dome in the middle of each face.
47600	49900	Sadly, this view won't last for long.
49900	55100	Rocks aren't strong enough to hold this shape, so the planet would eventually collapse into a regular sphere.
55100	57200	But for now, let's admire.
