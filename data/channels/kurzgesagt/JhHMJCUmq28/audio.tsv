0	6200	For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.
6700	12800	While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.
13200	21900	Since the 1960s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.
22500	25600	But this process is about to meet its physical limits.
25900	28800	Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.
29400	32800	To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.
39800	48500	A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things, representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.
49200	53900	Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors.
54600	63300	A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming through.
64000	68500	This information is made up of bits, which can be set to either 0 or 1.
69100	73000	Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.
73600	78000	Transistors are combined to create logic gates, which still do very simple stuff.
78200	85200	For example, an AND gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.
85700	91000	Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say for adding two numbers.
91400	97000	Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything.
97500	106100	Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first-grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions.
106600	110700	A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda.
111300	116100	However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky.
116700	119800	In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.
120200	127800	Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another, so a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.
128400	138500	Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nm, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell's.
139000	148200	As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called quantum tunneling.
148700	156500	In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense.
157100	161100	We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress.
161700	169200	To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers.
169800	173100	In normal computers, bits are the smallest units of information.
173600	177800	Quantum computers use qubits, which can also be set to one of two values.
178300	184100	A qubit can be any two-level quantum system, such as a spin in a magnetic field or a single photon.
184700	190700	Zero and one are this system's possible states, like the photon's horizontal or vertical polarization.
191300	197700	In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once.
198000	199900	This is called superposition.
200400	208700	But as soon as you test its value, say by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.
209300	216900	So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for zero and one, and you can't predict which it will be.
217500	221800	But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states.
222400	224500	Superposition is a game changer.
225100	230100	Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time.
230400	234300	That's sixteen possible combinations, out of which you can use just one.
235000	240300	Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those sixteen combinations at once.
240900	244000	This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.
244500	248100	Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel.
248700	252900	A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is entanglement,
253100	260100	a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart.
260700	267500	This means that when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of its partners without having to look.
268100	270700	Qubit manipulation is a mind-bender as well.
271200	276300	A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output.
276700	284900	A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output.
285400	291500	So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,
291700	297500	and finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of zeros and ones.
298000	304200	What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup all done at the same time.
304700	311700	Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results, and it will only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double-check and try again.
312700	320500	But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.
321700	328300	So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers, in some areas they are vastly superior.
328700	330500	One of them is database searching.
330800	335600	To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries.
336000	342000	Quantum algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases is a huge difference.
342800	346600	The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.
347200	356600	Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode.
357100	362100	The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key.
362600	367600	Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error.
368100	371900	But a quantum computer with exponential speedup could do it in a breeze.
372600	375300	Another really exciting new use is simulations.
375800	383900	Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures such as molecules, they often lack accuracy.
384500	388300	So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics?
389100	393800	Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine.
394500	400800	Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big revolution for humanity.
401200	406000	We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.
