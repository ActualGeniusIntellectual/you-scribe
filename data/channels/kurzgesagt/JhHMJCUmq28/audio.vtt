00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.

00:06.700 --> 00:12.800
While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.

00:13.200 --> 00:21.900
Since the 1960s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.600
But this process is about to meet its physical limits.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.800
Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.800
To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.

00:39.800 --> 00:48.500
A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things, representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.900
Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors.

00:54.600 --> 01:03.300
A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming through.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.500
This information is made up of bits, which can be set to either 0 or 1.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.000
Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.000
Transistors are combined to create logic gates, which still do very simple stuff.

01:18.200 --> 01:25.200
For example, an AND gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.

01:25.700 --> 01:31.000
Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say for adding two numbers.

01:31.400 --> 01:37.000
Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything.

01:37.500 --> 01:46.100
Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first-grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.700
A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda.

01:51.300 --> 01:56.100
However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.800
In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.

02:00.200 --> 02:07.800
Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another, so a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.

02:08.400 --> 02:18.500
Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nm, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell's.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.200
As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called quantum tunneling.

02:28.700 --> 02:36.500
In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.100
We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress.

02:41.700 --> 02:49.200
To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.100
In normal computers, bits are the smallest units of information.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.800
Quantum computers use qubits, which can also be set to one of two values.

02:58.300 --> 03:04.100
A qubit can be any two-level quantum system, such as a spin in a magnetic field or a single photon.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.700
Zero and one are this system's possible states, like the photon's horizontal or vertical polarization.

03:11.300 --> 03:17.700
In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.900
This is called superposition.

03:20.400 --> 03:28.700
But as soon as you test its value, say by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.

03:29.300 --> 03:36.900
So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for zero and one, and you can't predict which it will be.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.800
But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.500
Superposition is a game changer.

03:45.100 --> 03:50.100
Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.300
That's sixteen possible combinations, out of which you can use just one.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.300
Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those sixteen combinations at once.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.000
This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.100
Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel.

04:08.700 --> 04:12.900
A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is entanglement,

04:13.100 --> 04:20.100
a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart.

04:20.700 --> 04:27.500
This means that when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of its partners without having to look.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.700
Qubit manipulation is a mind-bender as well.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.300
A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output.

04:36.700 --> 04:44.900
A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output.

04:45.400 --> 04:51.500
So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,

04:51.700 --> 04:57.500
and finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of zeros and ones.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.200
What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup all done at the same time.

05:04.700 --> 05:11.700
Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results, and it will only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double-check and try again.

05:12.700 --> 05:20.500
But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.

05:21.700 --> 05:28.300
So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers, in some areas they are vastly superior.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.500
One of them is database searching.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.600
To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Quantum algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases is a huge difference.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.600
The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.

05:47.200 --> 05:56.600
Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode.

05:57.100 --> 06:02.100
The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.600
Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.900
But a quantum computer with exponential speedup could do it in a breeze.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.300
Another really exciting new use is simulations.

06:15.800 --> 06:23.900
Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures such as molecules, they often lack accuracy.

06:24.500 --> 06:28.300
So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics?

06:29.100 --> 06:33.800
Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine.

06:34.500 --> 06:40.800
Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big revolution for humanity.

06:41.200 --> 06:46.000
We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.
