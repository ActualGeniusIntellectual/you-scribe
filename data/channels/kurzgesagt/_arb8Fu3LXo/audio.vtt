00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
Are your friends more popular than you are?

00:02.500 --> 00:04.500
They are, at least on average.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.900
That's what science says.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.700
The weird thing is that the same applies to most of your friends.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.100
But how can that be?

00:10.100 --> 00:12.400
It takes some maths to prove this paradox,

00:12.400 --> 00:17.000
but simply put, it's just very likely that you're friends with someone who has a lot of friends.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.900
For this example, let's say Duck is that friend.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.400
Although people like Duck are rare,

00:21.400 --> 00:24.300
they have so many friends that they change the expected average.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.100
Pick a random person in your friend group and ask them how many friends their friends have.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.200
Chances are high that those friends are friends with the popular Duck.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.800
That way, the many friends of Duck contribute to the average more often,

00:34.800 --> 00:36.100
nudging it up slightly.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.600
You'll find this in your maths books as weighted average.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.500
The result?

00:40.500 --> 00:43.900
Most people in your group have fewer friends than their typical friend.

00:43.900 --> 00:47.100
So you might feel weird about this, but the same will happen to most people.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.800
The only question left is,

00:48.800 --> 00:50.600
are you the popular friend or...
