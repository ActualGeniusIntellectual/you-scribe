1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Are your friends more popular than you are?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
They are, at least on average.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,900
That's what science says.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,700
The weird thing is that the same applies to most of your friends.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,100
But how can that be?

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,400
It takes some maths to prove this paradox,

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,000
but simply put, it's just very likely that you're friends with someone who has a lot of friends.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,900
For this example, let's say Duck is that friend.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,400
Although people like Duck are rare,

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,300
they have so many friends that they change the expected average.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,100
Pick a random person in your friend group and ask them how many friends their friends have.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,200
Chances are high that those friends are friends with the popular Duck.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,800
That way, the many friends of Duck contribute to the average more often,

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,100
nudging it up slightly.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,600
You'll find this in your maths books as weighted average.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,500
The result?

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,900
Most people in your group have fewer friends than their typical friend.

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,100
So you might feel weird about this, but the same will happen to most people.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
The only question left is,

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,600
are you the popular friend or...
