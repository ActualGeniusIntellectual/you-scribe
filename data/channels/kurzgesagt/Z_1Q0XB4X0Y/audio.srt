1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
A three-story building is about ten meters tall, six times bigger than you.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,940
In the opposite direction, six times smaller than you, you get things like a cute squirrel,

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,060
about 27 centimeters small.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,920
So the building is just as big relative to you as you are to a squirrel.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,220
You're in the middle.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,220
It's easy to understand.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,320
In fact, you are in the middle of everything in the universe.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's go on a fantastical journey together, to the small and the large, and see if it's

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
really true.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
An A320 is 37 meters long.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,720
The Rufus hummingbird is around 7 centimeters.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,960
Both of these fliers are 23 times bigger or smaller than you, and both fly into continental

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,160
distances.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,140
The tiny bird migrates between Alaska and Mexico.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,140
If the hummingbird were the same size as the jet, it would circle the Earth 85 times every

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,140
year.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,060
Dinoponera, the largest ant in the world, is about 55 times smaller than you.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,020
Their small colonies have around 100 individuals, but no queens.

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,580
Instead, they ruthlessly compete for status within the nest, which can reach 1.2 meters

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,700
deep.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,540
If humans lived like Dinoponera, we'd be building towers of over 25 stories, filled

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,020
with offices and ruthlessly competing for status, and wait.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,700
The deadliest and most annoying insect in the world is the mosquito, 235 times smaller

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,240
than you, while on the other end, the Empire State Building is about that much larger than

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,420
you.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,500
Kind of unimaginable how something this small creates so much devastation for something

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
that big.

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,760
We're getting to the borders of human perception now.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,480
Like coarse grains of sand about 3 millimeters, 550 times smaller than you.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,240
You can feel their shape and roughness between your fingers, and if you focus, see them individually.

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,160
We mix them into concrete that can hold up the tallest towers ever built, like the 828

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,360
meter tall Burj Khalifa that's 500 times larger than you.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,400
If you were that tall, people would be as small to you as grains of sand in your hand.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Hey, be gentle.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,140
Anything smaller or bigger, and it becomes hard to grasp.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,700
A medium-sized city like Lisbon is about 6,000 times larger than yourself, and permeated

37
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,460
by a network of highways, roads, and alleys.

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,220
On the other end, about 6,000 times smaller than you, are your small arteries permeating

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
your whole body.

40
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,820
Actually, you're in the middle between your network of blood vessels and the network of

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,460
a city like Lisbon.

42
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,120
If you think of a city as a living being, you find more and more parallels.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,680
A small alley is as small to the city as an arterial 0.1 millimeters wide is to you.

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,560
Your tiniest capillaries are to you what the pipes bringing water to homes are to Lisbon.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,880
Going further, 100,000 times smaller than you, we reach a typical skin cell about 30

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,200
micrometers in diameter.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,860
A neutrophil is half as big, and one of your red blood cells is merely 7 micrometers.

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,740
They are as small to you as you are to the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, the largest

49
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,100
urban area in the world spanning over 160 kilometers.

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,920
You are so incredibly big, filled with so much complexity, so many different moving

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,420
parts.

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,780
Or are you just a cell in the human civilization's superstructure?

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,180
Are you both?

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,260
Our steps are getting larger and larger now.

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,780
Germany is around 875 kilometers from north to south, and the fourth biggest agricultural

56
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,940
exporter in the world.

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,660
Isobia is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria up to 3 micrometers long, and without it, that sort

58
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,620
of agricultural production is impossible.

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,540
So we have a country and a bacterium depending on each other, and you are in the middle,

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,140
both being roughly 550,000 times larger or smaller than you.

61
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,060
What about the whole Earth?

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,860
It's about 12,700 kilometers in diameter, about 7.7 million times larger than you.

63
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,220
On the other side of the scale is cornebacteria, as little as 0.3 micrometers across, living

64
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,460
on your skin and eyes along with 100 billion other bacteria, more than 10 times more than

65
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,180
there are humans on Earth.

66
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,420
Again, you're in the center, right in the middle of something so large that our civilization

67
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,220
is a mere scratch on its surface, and something so small and numerous you never notice its

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,780
presence even as it touches you.

69
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,040
Does that make you feel small or big?

70
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,520
From here on out, your brain is breaking a bit.

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,960
Four times wider than Earth is Neptune, a cold blue gas giant 49,500 kilometers wide.

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,400
The largest planet, though, is Jupiter, 140,000 kilometers in diameter, a titanic abyss shrouded

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,500
in terrible winds.

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,120
You could drop Earth whole into its depths, and it would simply vanish.

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,040
On the opposite scale, we find the deadly West Nile virus, 50 nanometers in diameter.

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,960
Or one step down, the spike proteins on a coronavirus that open up cells for its RNA

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
payload.

78
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,280
They are as small to you as you are to the planet Jupiter.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,440
You are in the middle between gigantic planets and the world of viruses, these tiny things,

80
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,720
so deadly.

81
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,260
Let that sink in.

82
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,720
A tiny virus is taking over and killing lung cells up to 500 times larger than itself with

83
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,700
the help of a tiny protein weapon.

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,940
That's like you trying to kill a giant the size of the Burj Khalifa with a screwdriver.

85
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,240
But the real boss of the solar system is the Sun, 10 times bigger than Jupiter, a billion

86
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,220
times larger than you, controlling all the planets and source of all energy that drives

87
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,220
life.

88
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,420
A billion times smaller than you, clearly the boss of our body, is a DNA strand containing

89
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,420
all the information making your life possible.

90
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,100
You're right in the middle between the most important factors keeping everything alive.

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,700
From here on, things just kind of stop making sense.

92
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,580
A billion is already too much, but now everything just seems to mean a lot.

93
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,100
The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is 14.5 billion

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,140
times bigger than you.

95
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,420
A hydrogen atom is 15.5 billion times smaller than you.

96
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,540
Yeah, okay, sure.

97
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,540
But the thing is, we're not even close to being done, and it's not impossible to get

98
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,800
at least a sense of how these scale.

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,580
The solar system is 22 trillion times larger than you.

100
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,920
On the other end of the scale is the wavelength of low-energy neutrinos released from fusion

101
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,760
reactions in our Sun.

102
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,680
About a hundred trillion of them are passing through you every single second, like ghosts

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,680
a trillion times smaller than you, basically never hitting any of the particles inside

104
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
you.

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
If you moved through the solar system in a straight line, you probably wouldn't hit

106
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,080
anything either.

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,200
Although things are beginning to get really weird now.

108
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,400
A single proton at the heart of the hydrogen atom is almost exactly one quadrillion times

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,860
smaller than you.

110
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,600
If the proton were as big as you, the hydrogen atoms would be taller than 12 Mount Everests.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,480
On the other end, we meet something that just breaks human brains.

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,620
The incredible vastness of space.

113
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,880
We just have no reference for these distances at all.

114
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,480
The distance to the closest star to Earth, Alpha Centauri, is not one quadrillion times

115
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,080
in the other direction from the tiny proton, but 24 quadrillion.

116
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,720
Space is just so large, it's kind of mean.

117
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,520
And it goes on like this.

118
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,200
A quintillion times smaller than you is the strange world of the quarks.

119
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,360
The proton is not actually like a tiny ball, but kind of just a ripple on the surface of

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,720
the ocean of quarks.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,840
Every moment, countless quarks pop into existence, along with their antiparticle enemies, before

122
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,980
doing furious battle and annihilating each other in an instant.

123
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
How many?

124
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,080
Impossible to say, because the harder you look for them, the more quarks seem to appear.

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,040
We're simplifying so much, it's like a lie anyway.

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,880
However we choose to illustrate this, it's wrong.

127
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,520
What actually is a quark?

128
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,800
What does it look like to human minds?

129
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
Nobody knows.

130
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,240
As you sit here confused, let's look up again.

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,920
The ocean of quarks in a proton, inside a single atom of a single cell of your body,

132
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,880
is as small to you as you are compared to a sphere around 174 light years across, containing

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,320
about 16,000 stars.

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,520
And this is just a tiny speck of dust to our galaxy.

135
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,040
The Milky Way is close to one sextillion times larger than you.

136
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,640
At the opposite end, we have particles a sextillion times smaller than yourself, like the wavelength

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,400
of high-energy neutrinos released when cosmic rays hit our atmosphere.

138
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,360
We're getting to the end.

139
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,400
The observable universe is 93 billion light years in diameter, close to a billion, billion,

140
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,480
billion human lengths.

141
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,020
But it's still finite.

142
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,380
There's only 465,000 Milky Ways side by side.

143
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,580
If you were the size of our galaxy, the observable universe would only be a day's drive across.

144
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,060
On the other end of that scale, we have the tiniest particle ever detected, a proton traveling

145
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,160
so close to the speed of light, it got squished into a pancake.

146
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,300
As small compared to you, as the whole observable universe is big to you.

147
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,580
We're at the border of things that we have evidence for.

148
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,060
Are you truly in the middle of everything?

149
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,620
The theoretical smallest physical distance is the Planck length, a hundred million times

150
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,300
smaller than even the pancake proton.

151
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,780
But we don't know if it's real, only that our theories of the universe break down here.

152
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,700
Likewise, on the other end, does the bigness of the universe match the smallness of the

153
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Planck length?

154
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,020
Well, actually, the universe could be considerably larger than that.

155
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,860
But we will never know.

156
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,500
Let's go back and look at the dimensions again.

157
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:21,860
There are so many big things, and so many small things wrapped up in them.

158
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:30,660
The universe seems to be exactly the right size, with you in the middle.

159
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,880
How do you try to get it exactly right, say, when you have to make a big choice, like buying

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,220
a new mattress?

161
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,000
You probably compare trustworthy reviews and test out a few models.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,100
But what if you plan to spend money on something you can't just return to the seller, and the

163
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,300
decision doesn't just affect your aching back?

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,500
GiveWell is an independent and rigorous resource for a different kind of purchase, a donation.

165
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,980
GiveWell's mission is to let donors make informed decisions about high-impact giving.

166
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,180
That's why they've now spent over 15 years researching charitable organizations and only

167
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,220
direct funding to a few of the highest impact opportunities they've found in global health

168
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,480
and poverty alleviation, and why we trust their judgment.

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,500
You can find all of their research and recommendations on their site for free.

170
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,340
Over 100,000 donors have used GiveWell to donate more than $1 billion.

171
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,900
These donations have the potential to save over 150,000 lives and improve the lives of

172
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,600
millions more.

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,140
If you've never donated through GiveWell before, you can have your donation matched up to $100

174
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,100
before the end of the year, or as long as matching funds last.

175
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,500
Donations made through them are tax-deductible, and GiveWell doesn't take a cut.

176
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,540
To claim your match, go to GiveWell.org, pick YouTube, and enter Kurzgesagt at checkout to

177
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,140
get your donation matched.

178
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,420
Thanks to all of you out there for all the love and support.

179
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,900
We wish you a peaceful and cozy turn of the year.

180
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,260
See you back at full throttle in January.
