0	6020	A three-story building is about ten meters tall, six times bigger than you.
6020	10940	In the opposite direction, six times smaller than you, you get things like a cute squirrel,
10940	14060	about 27 centimeters small.
14060	18920	So the building is just as big relative to you as you are to a squirrel.
18920	20220	You're in the middle.
20220	22220	It's easy to understand.
22220	26320	In fact, you are in the middle of everything in the universe.
26320	31680	Let's go on a fantastical journey together, to the small and the large, and see if it's
31680	33680	really true.
33680	36880	An A320 is 37 meters long.
36880	40720	The Rufus hummingbird is around 7 centimeters.
40720	45960	Both of these fliers are 23 times bigger or smaller than you, and both fly into continental
45960	47160	distances.
47160	51140	The tiny bird migrates between Alaska and Mexico.
51140	56140	If the hummingbird were the same size as the jet, it would circle the Earth 85 times every
56140	57140	year.
57140	64060	Dinoponera, the largest ant in the world, is about 55 times smaller than you.
64060	68020	Their small colonies have around 100 individuals, but no queens.
68020	73580	Instead, they ruthlessly compete for status within the nest, which can reach 1.2 meters
73580	74700	deep.
74700	79540	If humans lived like Dinoponera, we'd be building towers of over 25 stories, filled
79540	85020	with offices and ruthlessly competing for status, and wait.
85020	90700	The deadliest and most annoying insect in the world is the mosquito, 235 times smaller
90700	95240	than you, while on the other end, the Empire State Building is about that much larger than
95240	96420	you.
96420	101500	Kind of unimaginable how something this small creates so much devastation for something
101500	102500	that big.
102500	106760	We're getting to the borders of human perception now.
106760	112480	Like coarse grains of sand about 3 millimeters, 550 times smaller than you.
112480	118240	You can feel their shape and roughness between your fingers, and if you focus, see them individually.
118240	123160	We mix them into concrete that can hold up the tallest towers ever built, like the 828
123160	127360	meter tall Burj Khalifa that's 500 times larger than you.
127360	132400	If you were that tall, people would be as small to you as grains of sand in your hand.
132400	135200	Hey, be gentle.
135200	139140	Anything smaller or bigger, and it becomes hard to grasp.
139140	144700	A medium-sized city like Lisbon is about 6,000 times larger than yourself, and permeated
144700	148460	by a network of highways, roads, and alleys.
148460	153220	On the other end, about 6,000 times smaller than you, are your small arteries permeating
153220	154220	your whole body.
154220	158820	Actually, you're in the middle between your network of blood vessels and the network of
158820	160460	a city like Lisbon.
160460	165120	If you think of a city as a living being, you find more and more parallels.
165120	171680	A small alley is as small to the city as an arterial 0.1 millimeters wide is to you.
171680	177560	Your tiniest capillaries are to you what the pipes bringing water to homes are to Lisbon.
177560	182880	Going further, 100,000 times smaller than you, we reach a typical skin cell about 30
182880	184200	micrometers in diameter.
184200	189860	A neutrophil is half as big, and one of your red blood cells is merely 7 micrometers.
189860	194740	They are as small to you as you are to the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, the largest
194740	199100	urban area in the world spanning over 160 kilometers.
199100	203920	You are so incredibly big, filled with so much complexity, so many different moving
203920	205420	parts.
205420	209780	Or are you just a cell in the human civilization's superstructure?
209780	211180	Are you both?
211180	214260	Our steps are getting larger and larger now.
214260	219780	Germany is around 875 kilometers from north to south, and the fourth biggest agricultural
219780	221940	exporter in the world.
221940	227660	Isobia is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria up to 3 micrometers long, and without it, that sort
227660	230620	of agricultural production is impossible.
230620	235540	So we have a country and a bacterium depending on each other, and you are in the middle,
235540	241140	both being roughly 550,000 times larger or smaller than you.
241140	243060	What about the whole Earth?
243060	249860	It's about 12,700 kilometers in diameter, about 7.7 million times larger than you.
249860	255220	On the other side of the scale is cornebacteria, as little as 0.3 micrometers across, living
255220	260460	on your skin and eyes along with 100 billion other bacteria, more than 10 times more than
260460	262180	there are humans on Earth.
262180	267420	Again, you're in the center, right in the middle of something so large that our civilization
267420	272220	is a mere scratch on its surface, and something so small and numerous you never notice its
272220	274780	presence even as it touches you.
274780	278040	Does that make you feel small or big?
278060	281520	From here on out, your brain is breaking a bit.
281520	288960	Four times wider than Earth is Neptune, a cold blue gas giant 49,500 kilometers wide.
288960	296400	The largest planet, though, is Jupiter, 140,000 kilometers in diameter, a titanic abyss shrouded
296400	298500	in terrible winds.
298500	303120	You could drop Earth whole into its depths, and it would simply vanish.
303120	309040	On the opposite scale, we find the deadly West Nile virus, 50 nanometers in diameter.
309040	314960	Or one step down, the spike proteins on a coronavirus that open up cells for its RNA
314960	315960	payload.
315960	320280	They are as small to you as you are to the planet Jupiter.
320280	327440	You are in the middle between gigantic planets and the world of viruses, these tiny things,
327440	329720	so deadly.
329720	331260	Let that sink in.
331260	337720	A tiny virus is taking over and killing lung cells up to 500 times larger than itself with
337720	340700	the help of a tiny protein weapon.
340700	346940	That's like you trying to kill a giant the size of the Burj Khalifa with a screwdriver.
346940	352240	But the real boss of the solar system is the Sun, 10 times bigger than Jupiter, a billion
352240	357220	times larger than you, controlling all the planets and source of all energy that drives
357220	358220	life.
358220	363420	A billion times smaller than you, clearly the boss of our body, is a DNA strand containing
363420	366420	all the information making your life possible.
366420	371100	You're right in the middle between the most important factors keeping everything alive.
371100	374700	From here on, things just kind of stop making sense.
374700	379580	A billion is already too much, but now everything just seems to mean a lot.
379580	385100	The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is 14.5 billion
385100	387140	times bigger than you.
387140	391420	A hydrogen atom is 15.5 billion times smaller than you.
391420	393540	Yeah, okay, sure.
393540	397540	But the thing is, we're not even close to being done, and it's not impossible to get
397540	400800	at least a sense of how these scale.
400800	404580	The solar system is 22 trillion times larger than you.
404580	408920	On the other end of the scale is the wavelength of low-energy neutrinos released from fusion
408920	410760	reactions in our Sun.
410760	414680	About a hundred trillion of them are passing through you every single second, like ghosts
414680	418680	a trillion times smaller than you, basically never hitting any of the particles inside
418680	419680	you.
419680	423360	If you moved through the solar system in a straight line, you probably wouldn't hit
423360	425080	anything either.
425080	428200	Although things are beginning to get really weird now.
428200	433400	A single proton at the heart of the hydrogen atom is almost exactly one quadrillion times
433400	434860	smaller than you.
434860	441600	If the proton were as big as you, the hydrogen atoms would be taller than 12 Mount Everests.
441600	445480	On the other end, we meet something that just breaks human brains.
445480	447620	The incredible vastness of space.
447620	450880	We just have no reference for these distances at all.
450880	455480	The distance to the closest star to Earth, Alpha Centauri, is not one quadrillion times
455480	460080	in the other direction from the tiny proton, but 24 quadrillion.
460080	463720	Space is just so large, it's kind of mean.
463720	465520	And it goes on like this.
465520	470200	A quintillion times smaller than you is the strange world of the quarks.
470200	475360	The proton is not actually like a tiny ball, but kind of just a ripple on the surface of
475360	477720	the ocean of quarks.
477720	482840	Every moment, countless quarks pop into existence, along with their antiparticle enemies, before
482840	486980	doing furious battle and annihilating each other in an instant.
486980	487980	How many?
487980	493080	Impossible to say, because the harder you look for them, the more quarks seem to appear.
493080	496040	We're simplifying so much, it's like a lie anyway.
496040	498880	However we choose to illustrate this, it's wrong.
498880	500520	What actually is a quark?
500520	502800	What does it look like to human minds?
502800	504400	Nobody knows.
504400	508240	As you sit here confused, let's look up again.
508240	512920	The ocean of quarks in a proton, inside a single atom of a single cell of your body,
512920	518880	is as small to you as you are compared to a sphere around 174 light years across, containing
518880	521320	about 16,000 stars.
521320	524520	And this is just a tiny speck of dust to our galaxy.
524520	529040	The Milky Way is close to one sextillion times larger than you.
529040	534640	At the opposite end, we have particles a sextillion times smaller than yourself, like the wavelength
534640	539400	of high-energy neutrinos released when cosmic rays hit our atmosphere.
539400	541360	We're getting to the end.
541360	548400	The observable universe is 93 billion light years in diameter, close to a billion, billion,
548400	550480	billion human lengths.
550480	553020	But it's still finite.
553020	558380	There's only 465,000 Milky Ways side by side.
558380	564580	If you were the size of our galaxy, the observable universe would only be a day's drive across.
564580	569060	On the other end of that scale, we have the tiniest particle ever detected, a proton traveling
569060	573160	so close to the speed of light, it got squished into a pancake.
573160	578300	As small compared to you, as the whole observable universe is big to you.
578300	581580	We're at the border of things that we have evidence for.
581580	584060	Are you truly in the middle of everything?
584060	588620	The theoretical smallest physical distance is the Planck length, a hundred million times
588620	591300	smaller than even the pancake proton.
591300	595780	But we don't know if it's real, only that our theories of the universe break down here.
595780	600700	Likewise, on the other end, does the bigness of the universe match the smallness of the
600700	601700	Planck length?
601700	606020	Well, actually, the universe could be considerably larger than that.
606020	608860	But we will never know.
608860	614500	Let's go back and look at the dimensions again.
614500	621860	There are so many big things, and so many small things wrapped up in them.
621860	630660	The universe seems to be exactly the right size, with you in the middle.
630660	634880	How do you try to get it exactly right, say, when you have to make a big choice, like buying
634880	636220	a new mattress?
636220	640000	You probably compare trustworthy reviews and test out a few models.
640000	644100	But what if you plan to spend money on something you can't just return to the seller, and the
644100	647300	decision doesn't just affect your aching back?
