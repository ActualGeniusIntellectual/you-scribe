00:00.000 --> 00:06.020
A three-story building is about ten meters tall, six times bigger than you.

00:06.020 --> 00:10.940
In the opposite direction, six times smaller than you, you get things like a cute squirrel,

00:10.940 --> 00:14.060
about 27 centimeters small.

00:14.060 --> 00:18.920
So the building is just as big relative to you as you are to a squirrel.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.220
You're in the middle.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.220
It's easy to understand.

00:22.220 --> 00:26.320
In fact, you are in the middle of everything in the universe.

00:26.320 --> 00:31.680
Let's go on a fantastical journey together, to the small and the large, and see if it's

00:31.680 --> 00:33.680
really true.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.880
An A320 is 37 meters long.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.720
The Rufus hummingbird is around 7 centimeters.

00:40.720 --> 00:45.960
Both of these fliers are 23 times bigger or smaller than you, and both fly into continental

00:45.960 --> 00:47.160
distances.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.140
The tiny bird migrates between Alaska and Mexico.

00:51.140 --> 00:56.140
If the hummingbird were the same size as the jet, it would circle the Earth 85 times every

00:56.140 --> 00:57.140
year.

00:57.140 --> 01:04.060
Dinoponera, the largest ant in the world, is about 55 times smaller than you.

01:04.060 --> 01:08.020
Their small colonies have around 100 individuals, but no queens.

01:08.020 --> 01:13.580
Instead, they ruthlessly compete for status within the nest, which can reach 1.2 meters

01:13.580 --> 01:14.700
deep.

01:14.700 --> 01:19.540
If humans lived like Dinoponera, we'd be building towers of over 25 stories, filled

01:19.540 --> 01:25.020
with offices and ruthlessly competing for status, and wait.

01:25.020 --> 01:30.700
The deadliest and most annoying insect in the world is the mosquito, 235 times smaller

01:30.700 --> 01:35.240
than you, while on the other end, the Empire State Building is about that much larger than

01:35.240 --> 01:36.420
you.

01:36.420 --> 01:41.500
Kind of unimaginable how something this small creates so much devastation for something

01:41.500 --> 01:42.500
that big.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.760
We're getting to the borders of human perception now.

01:46.760 --> 01:52.480
Like coarse grains of sand about 3 millimeters, 550 times smaller than you.

01:52.480 --> 01:58.240
You can feel their shape and roughness between your fingers, and if you focus, see them individually.

01:58.240 --> 02:03.160
We mix them into concrete that can hold up the tallest towers ever built, like the 828

02:03.160 --> 02:07.360
meter tall Burj Khalifa that's 500 times larger than you.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.400
If you were that tall, people would be as small to you as grains of sand in your hand.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.200
Hey, be gentle.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.140
Anything smaller or bigger, and it becomes hard to grasp.

02:19.140 --> 02:24.700
A medium-sized city like Lisbon is about 6,000 times larger than yourself, and permeated

02:24.700 --> 02:28.460
by a network of highways, roads, and alleys.

02:28.460 --> 02:33.220
On the other end, about 6,000 times smaller than you, are your small arteries permeating

02:33.220 --> 02:34.220
your whole body.

02:34.220 --> 02:38.820
Actually, you're in the middle between your network of blood vessels and the network of

02:38.820 --> 02:40.460
a city like Lisbon.

02:40.460 --> 02:45.120
If you think of a city as a living being, you find more and more parallels.

02:45.120 --> 02:51.680
A small alley is as small to the city as an arterial 0.1 millimeters wide is to you.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.560
Your tiniest capillaries are to you what the pipes bringing water to homes are to Lisbon.

02:57.560 --> 03:02.880
Going further, 100,000 times smaller than you, we reach a typical skin cell about 30

03:02.880 --> 03:04.200
micrometers in diameter.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.860
A neutrophil is half as big, and one of your red blood cells is merely 7 micrometers.

03:09.860 --> 03:14.740
They are as small to you as you are to the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, the largest

03:14.740 --> 03:19.100
urban area in the world spanning over 160 kilometers.

03:19.100 --> 03:23.920
You are so incredibly big, filled with so much complexity, so many different moving

03:23.920 --> 03:25.420
parts.

03:25.420 --> 03:29.780
Or are you just a cell in the human civilization's superstructure?

03:29.780 --> 03:31.180
Are you both?

03:31.180 --> 03:34.260
Our steps are getting larger and larger now.

03:34.260 --> 03:39.780
Germany is around 875 kilometers from north to south, and the fourth biggest agricultural

03:39.780 --> 03:41.940
exporter in the world.

03:41.940 --> 03:47.660
Isobia is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria up to 3 micrometers long, and without it, that sort

03:47.660 --> 03:50.620
of agricultural production is impossible.

03:50.620 --> 03:55.540
So we have a country and a bacterium depending on each other, and you are in the middle,

03:55.540 --> 04:01.140
both being roughly 550,000 times larger or smaller than you.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.060
What about the whole Earth?

04:03.060 --> 04:09.860
It's about 12,700 kilometers in diameter, about 7.7 million times larger than you.

04:09.860 --> 04:15.220
On the other side of the scale is cornebacteria, as little as 0.3 micrometers across, living

04:15.220 --> 04:20.460
on your skin and eyes along with 100 billion other bacteria, more than 10 times more than

04:20.460 --> 04:22.180
there are humans on Earth.

04:22.180 --> 04:27.420
Again, you're in the center, right in the middle of something so large that our civilization

04:27.420 --> 04:32.220
is a mere scratch on its surface, and something so small and numerous you never notice its

04:32.220 --> 04:34.780
presence even as it touches you.

04:34.780 --> 04:38.040
Does that make you feel small or big?

04:38.060 --> 04:41.520
From here on out, your brain is breaking a bit.

04:41.520 --> 04:48.960
Four times wider than Earth is Neptune, a cold blue gas giant 49,500 kilometers wide.

04:48.960 --> 04:56.400
The largest planet, though, is Jupiter, 140,000 kilometers in diameter, a titanic abyss shrouded

04:56.400 --> 04:58.500
in terrible winds.

04:58.500 --> 05:03.120
You could drop Earth whole into its depths, and it would simply vanish.

05:03.120 --> 05:09.040
On the opposite scale, we find the deadly West Nile virus, 50 nanometers in diameter.

05:09.040 --> 05:14.960
Or one step down, the spike proteins on a coronavirus that open up cells for its RNA

05:14.960 --> 05:15.960
payload.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.280
They are as small to you as you are to the planet Jupiter.

05:20.280 --> 05:27.440
You are in the middle between gigantic planets and the world of viruses, these tiny things,

05:27.440 --> 05:29.720
so deadly.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.260
Let that sink in.

05:31.260 --> 05:37.720
A tiny virus is taking over and killing lung cells up to 500 times larger than itself with

05:37.720 --> 05:40.700
the help of a tiny protein weapon.

05:40.700 --> 05:46.940
That's like you trying to kill a giant the size of the Burj Khalifa with a screwdriver.

05:46.940 --> 05:52.240
But the real boss of the solar system is the Sun, 10 times bigger than Jupiter, a billion

05:52.240 --> 05:57.220
times larger than you, controlling all the planets and source of all energy that drives

05:57.220 --> 05:58.220
life.

05:58.220 --> 06:03.420
A billion times smaller than you, clearly the boss of our body, is a DNA strand containing

06:03.420 --> 06:06.420
all the information making your life possible.

06:06.420 --> 06:11.100
You're right in the middle between the most important factors keeping everything alive.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.700
From here on, things just kind of stop making sense.

06:14.700 --> 06:19.580
A billion is already too much, but now everything just seems to mean a lot.

06:19.580 --> 06:25.100
The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is 14.5 billion

06:25.100 --> 06:27.140
times bigger than you.

06:27.140 --> 06:31.420
A hydrogen atom is 15.5 billion times smaller than you.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.540
Yeah, okay, sure.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.540
But the thing is, we're not even close to being done, and it's not impossible to get

06:37.540 --> 06:40.800
at least a sense of how these scale.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.580
The solar system is 22 trillion times larger than you.

06:44.580 --> 06:48.920
On the other end of the scale is the wavelength of low-energy neutrinos released from fusion

06:48.920 --> 06:50.760
reactions in our Sun.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.680
About a hundred trillion of them are passing through you every single second, like ghosts

06:54.680 --> 06:58.680
a trillion times smaller than you, basically never hitting any of the particles inside

06:58.680 --> 06:59.680
you.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.360
If you moved through the solar system in a straight line, you probably wouldn't hit

07:03.360 --> 07:05.080
anything either.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.200
Although things are beginning to get really weird now.

07:08.200 --> 07:13.400
A single proton at the heart of the hydrogen atom is almost exactly one quadrillion times

07:13.400 --> 07:14.860
smaller than you.

07:14.860 --> 07:21.600
If the proton were as big as you, the hydrogen atoms would be taller than 12 Mount Everests.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.480
On the other end, we meet something that just breaks human brains.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.620
The incredible vastness of space.

07:27.620 --> 07:30.880
We just have no reference for these distances at all.

07:30.880 --> 07:35.480
The distance to the closest star to Earth, Alpha Centauri, is not one quadrillion times

07:35.480 --> 07:40.080
in the other direction from the tiny proton, but 24 quadrillion.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.720
Space is just so large, it's kind of mean.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.520
And it goes on like this.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.200
A quintillion times smaller than you is the strange world of the quarks.

07:50.200 --> 07:55.360
The proton is not actually like a tiny ball, but kind of just a ripple on the surface of

07:55.360 --> 07:57.720
the ocean of quarks.

07:57.720 --> 08:02.840
Every moment, countless quarks pop into existence, along with their antiparticle enemies, before

08:02.840 --> 08:06.980
doing furious battle and annihilating each other in an instant.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.980
How many?

08:07.980 --> 08:13.080
Impossible to say, because the harder you look for them, the more quarks seem to appear.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.040
We're simplifying so much, it's like a lie anyway.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.880
However we choose to illustrate this, it's wrong.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.520
What actually is a quark?

08:20.520 --> 08:22.800
What does it look like to human minds?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.400
Nobody knows.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.240
As you sit here confused, let's look up again.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.920
The ocean of quarks in a proton, inside a single atom of a single cell of your body,

08:32.920 --> 08:38.880
is as small to you as you are compared to a sphere around 174 light years across, containing

08:38.880 --> 08:41.320
about 16,000 stars.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.520
And this is just a tiny speck of dust to our galaxy.

08:44.520 --> 08:49.040
The Milky Way is close to one sextillion times larger than you.

08:49.040 --> 08:54.640
At the opposite end, we have particles a sextillion times smaller than yourself, like the wavelength

08:54.640 --> 08:59.400
of high-energy neutrinos released when cosmic rays hit our atmosphere.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.360
We're getting to the end.

09:01.360 --> 09:08.400
The observable universe is 93 billion light years in diameter, close to a billion, billion,

09:08.400 --> 09:10.480
billion human lengths.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.020
But it's still finite.

09:13.020 --> 09:18.380
There's only 465,000 Milky Ways side by side.

09:18.380 --> 09:24.580
If you were the size of our galaxy, the observable universe would only be a day's drive across.

09:24.580 --> 09:29.060
On the other end of that scale, we have the tiniest particle ever detected, a proton traveling

09:29.060 --> 09:33.160
so close to the speed of light, it got squished into a pancake.

09:33.160 --> 09:38.300
As small compared to you, as the whole observable universe is big to you.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.580
We're at the border of things that we have evidence for.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.060
Are you truly in the middle of everything?

09:44.060 --> 09:48.620
The theoretical smallest physical distance is the Planck length, a hundred million times

09:48.620 --> 09:51.300
smaller than even the pancake proton.

09:51.300 --> 09:55.780
But we don't know if it's real, only that our theories of the universe break down here.

09:55.780 --> 10:00.700
Likewise, on the other end, does the bigness of the universe match the smallness of the

10:00.700 --> 10:01.700
Planck length?

10:01.700 --> 10:06.020
Well, actually, the universe could be considerably larger than that.

10:06.020 --> 10:08.860
But we will never know.

10:08.860 --> 10:14.500
Let's go back and look at the dimensions again.

10:14.500 --> 10:21.860
There are so many big things, and so many small things wrapped up in them.

10:21.860 --> 10:30.660
The universe seems to be exactly the right size, with you in the middle.

10:30.660 --> 10:34.880
How do you try to get it exactly right, say, when you have to make a big choice, like buying

10:34.880 --> 10:36.220
a new mattress?

10:36.220 --> 10:40.000
You probably compare trustworthy reviews and test out a few models.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.100
But what if you plan to spend money on something you can't just return to the seller, and the

10:44.100 --> 10:47.300
decision doesn't just affect your aching back?

10:47.300 --> 10:53.500
GiveWell is an independent and rigorous resource for a different kind of purchase, a donation.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.980
GiveWell's mission is to let donors make informed decisions about high-impact giving.

10:57.980 --> 11:02.180
That's why they've now spent over 15 years researching charitable organizations and only

11:02.180 --> 11:06.220
direct funding to a few of the highest impact opportunities they've found in global health

11:06.220 --> 11:10.480
and poverty alleviation, and why we trust their judgment.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.500
You can find all of their research and recommendations on their site for free.

11:14.500 --> 11:20.340
Over 100,000 donors have used GiveWell to donate more than $1 billion.

11:20.340 --> 11:25.900
These donations have the potential to save over 150,000 lives and improve the lives of

11:25.900 --> 11:27.600
millions more.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.140
If you've never donated through GiveWell before, you can have your donation matched up to $100

11:32.140 --> 11:36.100
before the end of the year, or as long as matching funds last.

11:36.100 --> 11:40.500
Donations made through them are tax-deductible, and GiveWell doesn't take a cut.

11:40.500 --> 11:46.540
To claim your match, go to GiveWell.org, pick YouTube, and enter Kurzgesagt at checkout to

11:46.540 --> 11:48.140
get your donation matched.

12:02.140 --> 12:08.420
Thanks to all of you out there for all the love and support.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.900
We wish you a peaceful and cozy turn of the year.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.260
See you back at full throttle in January.
