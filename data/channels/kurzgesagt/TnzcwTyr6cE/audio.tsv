0	7000	What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator?
7000	11820	The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions,
11820	17800	the mighty mosquito. Along with other diseases, it plays host to malaria,
17800	23120	one of the cruelest parasites on Earth, possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history.
23120	29040	In 2015 alone, hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died.
29040	34780	A new technology could help us eradicate malaria forever. But to do so,
34780	40880	we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem. The modified
40880	48000	mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology and is malaria bad enough to risk it?
48000	65160	Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms, plasmodia. Very weird microorganisms that consist
65160	71720	of just a single cell. They're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always
71720	77280	starts with an insect bite. In its salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until
77280	82280	the insect penetrates your skin. Immediately after invading you, they head for the liver,
82280	87400	where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month,
87400	92800	they stay here in stealth mode, consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form,
92800	99280	small drop-like myriozoites. They multiply, generating thousands of themselves and then
99280	104920	burst out of the cells. So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next
104920	110520	victims, red blood cells. To stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the
110520	116200	cells they killed. Imagine that, killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as
116200	123040	camouflage. Brutal. They now violently attack red blood cells, multiplying inside them until they
123040	129240	burst, then finding more red blood cells, and this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells
129240	134000	spread lots of toxic waste material, which activates a powerful immune response, causing
134000	140120	flu-like symptoms. Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions, headaches,
140120	145920	and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the blood-brain barrier, it can cause
145920	152600	coma, neurological damage, or death. The parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another
152600	159200	mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride. The cycle can start over. In 2015,
159200	163040	the Zika virus, which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women,
163080	169680	spread rapidly into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is
169680	174840	the perfect carrier for human diseases. They've been around for at least 200 million years. There
174840	181460	are trillions of them, and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time. They are practically
181460	187440	impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi. But today we have new revolutionary
187440	193200	technology that could enable us to finally win the war against them. CRISPR. For the first time
193200	199160	in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species,
199160	206480	changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects,
206480	213120	why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists
213120	218360	successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a
218360	224360	new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never spread
224360	231240	malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits would only be inherited
231240	236760	by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So
236760	241280	after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene.
241280	247440	In a population of billions of mosquitoes, they would hardly make a difference. A genetic
247440	252760	engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become
252760	258360	dominant in the following generations, overpowering the old gene almost completely. Thanks to this
258360	264720	twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes' offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit.
264720	270320	If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,
270360	276000	the malaria blocking genes would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent
276000	281240	feature of the mosquito population, plasmodium would lose its home base. Scientists hope that
281240	286560	the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually
286560	291400	disappear. If you take into account that nearly half a million children are killed by it every
291400	296760	year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists argue that we should
296760	302080	use the technology sooner rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably only
302080	308000	profit from this. They don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites. And this might only be the
308000	314040	first step. Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and
314040	321080	Zika. Ticks transmit Lyme disease. Flies transmit sleeping sickness. Fleas transmit the plague. We
321080	327600	could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So why haven't we done
327600	334120	this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old, so until very recently, we just couldn't
334120	340560	do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns. Never before have humans consciously
340560	346880	changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this scale. Once we do it, there is no going
346880	352720	back. So it has to be done right, because there could be unwanted consequences if we set out to
352720	358440	edit nature. In the specific case of malaria, though, the risk might be acceptable, since the
358440	363080	genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the overall genome, it only changes a very
363080	368880	specific part. The worst-case scenario here is probably that it might not work, or that the
368880	376640	parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive
376960	382520	needs to be handled with a lot of care. But at some point, we have to ask ourselves, is it
382520	390040	unethical to not use this technology when every day 1,000 children die? Humanity has to decide
390040	395520	how to act on this in the next few years. The public discussion is way behind the technology
395520	404000	in this case. What do you think? This video was made possible in part by viewer donations on
