00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator?

00:07.000 --> 00:11.820
The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions,

00:11.820 --> 00:17.800
the mighty mosquito. Along with other diseases, it plays host to malaria,

00:17.800 --> 00:23.120
one of the cruelest parasites on Earth, possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history.

00:23.120 --> 00:29.040
In 2015 alone, hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.780
A new technology could help us eradicate malaria forever. But to do so,

00:34.780 --> 00:40.880
we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem. The modified

00:40.880 --> 00:48.000
mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology and is malaria bad enough to risk it?

00:48.000 --> 01:05.160
Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms, plasmodia. Very weird microorganisms that consist

01:05.160 --> 01:11.720
of just a single cell. They're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always

01:11.720 --> 01:17.280
starts with an insect bite. In its salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until

01:17.280 --> 01:22.280
the insect penetrates your skin. Immediately after invading you, they head for the liver,

01:22.280 --> 01:27.400
where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month,

01:27.400 --> 01:32.800
they stay here in stealth mode, consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form,

01:32.800 --> 01:39.280
small drop-like myriozoites. They multiply, generating thousands of themselves and then

01:39.280 --> 01:44.920
burst out of the cells. So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next

01:44.920 --> 01:50.520
victims, red blood cells. To stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the

01:50.520 --> 01:56.200
cells they killed. Imagine that, killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as

01:56.200 --> 02:03.040
camouflage. Brutal. They now violently attack red blood cells, multiplying inside them until they

02:03.040 --> 02:09.240
burst, then finding more red blood cells, and this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells

02:09.240 --> 02:14.000
spread lots of toxic waste material, which activates a powerful immune response, causing

02:14.000 --> 02:20.120
flu-like symptoms. Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions, headaches,

02:20.120 --> 02:25.920
and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the blood-brain barrier, it can cause

02:25.920 --> 02:32.600
coma, neurological damage, or death. The parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another

02:32.600 --> 02:39.200
mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride. The cycle can start over. In 2015,

02:39.200 --> 02:43.040
the Zika virus, which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women,

02:43.080 --> 02:49.680
spread rapidly into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is

02:49.680 --> 02:54.840
the perfect carrier for human diseases. They've been around for at least 200 million years. There

02:54.840 --> 03:01.460
are trillions of them, and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time. They are practically

03:01.460 --> 03:07.440
impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi. But today we have new revolutionary

03:07.440 --> 03:13.200
technology that could enable us to finally win the war against them. CRISPR. For the first time

03:13.200 --> 03:19.160
in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species,

03:19.160 --> 03:26.480
changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects,

03:26.480 --> 03:33.120
why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists

03:33.120 --> 03:38.360
successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a

03:38.360 --> 03:44.360
new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never spread

03:44.360 --> 03:51.240
malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits would only be inherited

03:51.240 --> 03:56.760
by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So

03:56.760 --> 04:01.280
after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene.

04:01.280 --> 04:07.440
In a population of billions of mosquitoes, they would hardly make a difference. A genetic

04:07.440 --> 04:12.760
engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become

04:12.760 --> 04:18.360
dominant in the following generations, overpowering the old gene almost completely. Thanks to this

04:18.360 --> 04:24.720
twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes' offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit.

04:24.720 --> 04:30.320
If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,

04:30.360 --> 04:36.000
the malaria blocking genes would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent

04:36.000 --> 04:41.240
feature of the mosquito population, plasmodium would lose its home base. Scientists hope that

04:41.240 --> 04:46.560
the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually

04:46.560 --> 04:51.400
disappear. If you take into account that nearly half a million children are killed by it every

04:51.400 --> 04:56.760
year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists argue that we should

04:56.760 --> 05:02.080
use the technology sooner rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably only

05:02.080 --> 05:08.000
profit from this. They don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites. And this might only be the

05:08.000 --> 05:14.040
first step. Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and

05:14.040 --> 05:21.080
Zika. Ticks transmit Lyme disease. Flies transmit sleeping sickness. Fleas transmit the plague. We

05:21.080 --> 05:27.600
could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So why haven't we done

05:27.600 --> 05:34.120
this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old, so until very recently, we just couldn't

05:34.120 --> 05:40.560
do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns. Never before have humans consciously

05:40.560 --> 05:46.880
changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this scale. Once we do it, there is no going

05:46.880 --> 05:52.720
back. So it has to be done right, because there could be unwanted consequences if we set out to

05:52.720 --> 05:58.440
edit nature. In the specific case of malaria, though, the risk might be acceptable, since the

05:58.440 --> 06:03.080
genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the overall genome, it only changes a very

06:03.080 --> 06:08.880
specific part. The worst-case scenario here is probably that it might not work, or that the

06:08.880 --> 06:16.640
parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive

06:16.960 --> 06:22.520
needs to be handled with a lot of care. But at some point, we have to ask ourselves, is it

06:22.520 --> 06:30.040
unethical to not use this technology when every day 1,000 children die? Humanity has to decide

06:30.040 --> 06:35.520
how to act on this in the next few years. The public discussion is way behind the technology

06:35.520 --> 06:44.000
in this case. What do you think? This video was made possible in part by viewer donations on
