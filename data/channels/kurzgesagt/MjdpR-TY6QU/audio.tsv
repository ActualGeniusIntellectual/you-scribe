800	6000	Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.
6800	11840	We're living longer than ever before, which is great. But an unforeseen consequence of this
11840	15920	is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.
16880	23600	Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the
23600	28720	attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing health
28720	34320	spans – the part of our lives during which we are disease-free. To do this, we need to
34320	40560	attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects – aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the
40560	45680	science of aging has made enormous progress in the last few years, with human trials about to begin
45680	51520	in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are
51520	52640	alive right now.
63040	64720	1. Senescent cells.
67040	73120	Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.
73840	77680	Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.
78400	83200	This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves, we have long segments of DNA
83200	87200	called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces.
87200	92480	But they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions,
92480	96800	the telomeres are gone and the cell becomes a zombie – a senescent cell.
97680	103360	Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get, the more of them there are inside
103360	109120	you. They harm tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age,
109120	113440	like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off?
114800	119440	Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they
119440	124880	pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active, their hearts and kidneys worked
124880	130880	better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30% longer and in
130880	135840	better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all of the cells
135840	140880	in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we
140880	146640	kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell
146640	152560	suicide when they're damaged. But senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a
152560	159120	protein that tells them when it's time to die. So, in a late 2016 study, mice were given an
159120	165200	injection of this protein. It killed 80% of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no
165200	171280	harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.
172240	176320	As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving
176320	179520	senescent cells, and the first human trials will start soon.
181200	188320	2. NAD+. Cells are made from hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures,
188320	194800	machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need
194800	200560	to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective,
200560	206880	and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower. Or they are no longer produced
206880	213600	in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells our cells to look
213600	220080	after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.
220960	225760	Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases, from skin cancer to Alzheimer's,
225760	232640	cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+, can't enter cells, so we can't get it
232640	237840	as a pill. But scientists noticed that other, more flexible substances could enter cells,
237840	244720	and would then turn into NAD+, inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted
244720	251360	the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability
251360	257840	to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan. This even got NASA interested, which is
257840	262400	looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic
262400	268400	radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say
268400	274960	if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+, is a serious candidate, and could become
274960	284480	the first human anti-aging pill. 3. Stem cells. Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at
284480	289440	various places in the body, and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells.
290000	296560	But they decline as we age, and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break.
297600	302720	In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started
302720	309520	to develop diseases. So they took stem cells from baby mice brains, and injected them directly into
309520	315360	the brains of middle-aged mice. More specifically, the hypothalamus, a part that's involved in
315360	321440	regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by
321440	327200	secreting micro-RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After four months, brain and muscles
327200	333920	worked better than those of untreated mice, and on average, they lived 10% longer. Another study
333920	338880	took stem cells from mice embryos, and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.
339760	342560	As a consequence, they had improved heart function,
342560	347840	could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough, their hair regrew faster.
352880	358000	What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.
358000	363120	It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells
363120	367120	to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap,
367120	370720	all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.
372080	377440	This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.
378080	382160	There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent,
382160	387760	but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own health span,
387760	393120	we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now,
393120	398160	and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of health span extension needs more
398160	404480	attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain.
