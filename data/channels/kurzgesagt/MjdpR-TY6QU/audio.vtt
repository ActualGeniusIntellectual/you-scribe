00:00.800 --> 00:06.000
Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.840
We're living longer than ever before, which is great. But an unforeseen consequence of this

00:11.840 --> 00:15.920
is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.

00:16.880 --> 00:23.600
Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the

00:23.600 --> 00:28.720
attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing health

00:28.720 --> 00:34.320
spans – the part of our lives during which we are disease-free. To do this, we need to

00:34.320 --> 00:40.560
attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects – aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the

00:40.560 --> 00:45.680
science of aging has made enormous progress in the last few years, with human trials about to begin

00:45.680 --> 00:51.520
in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are

00:51.520 --> 00:52.640
alive right now.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.720
1. Senescent cells.

01:07.040 --> 01:13.120
Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.680
Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.200
This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves, we have long segments of DNA

01:23.200 --> 01:27.200
called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.480
But they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions,

01:32.480 --> 01:36.800
the telomeres are gone and the cell becomes a zombie – a senescent cell.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.360
Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get, the more of them there are inside

01:43.360 --> 01:49.120
you. They harm tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age,

01:49.120 --> 01:53.440
like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off?

01:54.800 --> 01:59.440
Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they

01:59.440 --> 02:04.880
pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active, their hearts and kidneys worked

02:04.880 --> 02:10.880
better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30% longer and in

02:10.880 --> 02:15.840
better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all of the cells

02:15.840 --> 02:20.880
in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we

02:20.880 --> 02:26.640
kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell

02:26.640 --> 02:32.560
suicide when they're damaged. But senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a

02:32.560 --> 02:39.120
protein that tells them when it's time to die. So, in a late 2016 study, mice were given an

02:39.120 --> 02:45.200
injection of this protein. It killed 80% of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no

02:45.200 --> 02:51.280
harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.320
As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving

02:56.320 --> 02:59.520
senescent cells, and the first human trials will start soon.

03:01.200 --> 03:08.320
2. NAD+. Cells are made from hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures,

03:08.320 --> 03:14.800
machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need

03:14.800 --> 03:20.560
to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective,

03:20.560 --> 03:26.880
and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower. Or they are no longer produced

03:26.880 --> 03:33.600
in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells our cells to look

03:33.600 --> 03:40.080
after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.760
Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases, from skin cancer to Alzheimer's,

03:45.760 --> 03:52.640
cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+, can't enter cells, so we can't get it

03:52.640 --> 03:57.840
as a pill. But scientists noticed that other, more flexible substances could enter cells,

03:57.840 --> 04:04.720
and would then turn into NAD+, inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted

04:04.720 --> 04:11.360
the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability

04:11.360 --> 04:17.840
to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan. This even got NASA interested, which is

04:17.840 --> 04:22.400
looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic

04:22.400 --> 04:28.400
radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say

04:28.400 --> 04:34.960
if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+, is a serious candidate, and could become

04:34.960 --> 04:44.480
the first human anti-aging pill. 3. Stem cells. Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at

04:44.480 --> 04:49.440
various places in the body, and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.560
But they decline as we age, and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.720
In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started

05:02.720 --> 05:09.520
to develop diseases. So they took stem cells from baby mice brains, and injected them directly into

05:09.520 --> 05:15.360
the brains of middle-aged mice. More specifically, the hypothalamus, a part that's involved in

05:15.360 --> 05:21.440
regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by

05:21.440 --> 05:27.200
secreting micro-RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After four months, brain and muscles

05:27.200 --> 05:33.920
worked better than those of untreated mice, and on average, they lived 10% longer. Another study

05:33.920 --> 05:38.880
took stem cells from mice embryos, and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.560
As a consequence, they had improved heart function,

05:42.560 --> 05:47.840
could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough, their hair regrew faster.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.000
What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.120
It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells

06:03.120 --> 06:07.120
to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap,

06:07.120 --> 06:10.720
all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.440
This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.160
There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent,

06:22.160 --> 06:27.760
but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own health span,

06:27.760 --> 06:33.120
we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now,

06:33.120 --> 06:38.160
and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of health span extension needs more

06:38.160 --> 06:44.480
attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain.
