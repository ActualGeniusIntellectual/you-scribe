00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,000
Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,840
We're living longer than ever before, which is great. But an unforeseen consequence of this

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,600
Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,720
attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing health

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,320
spans – the part of our lives during which we are disease-free. To do this, we need to

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,560
attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects – aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,680
science of aging has made enormous progress in the last few years, with human trials about to begin

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,520
in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,640
alive right now.

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,720
1. Senescent cells.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves, we have long segments of DNA

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,480
But they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions,

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,800
the telomeres are gone and the cell becomes a zombie – a senescent cell.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,360
Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get, the more of them there are inside

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,120
you. They harm tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age,

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,440
like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off?

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,440
Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,880
pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active, their hearts and kidneys worked

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,880
better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30% longer and in

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,840
better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all of the cells

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,880
in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,640
kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,560
suicide when they're damaged. But senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,120
protein that tells them when it's time to die. So, in a late 2016 study, mice were given an

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,200
injection of this protein. It killed 80% of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,280
harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,320
As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving

32
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,520
senescent cells, and the first human trials will start soon.

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,320
2. NAD+. Cells are made from hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures,

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,800
machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,560
to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective,

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,880
and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower. Or they are no longer produced

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,600
in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells our cells to look

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,080
after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,760
Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases, from skin cancer to Alzheimer's,

40
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,640
cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+, can't enter cells, so we can't get it

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
as a pill. But scientists noticed that other, more flexible substances could enter cells,

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,720
and would then turn into NAD+, inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,360
the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability

44
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,840
to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan. This even got NASA interested, which is

45
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,400
looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,400
radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,960
if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+, is a serious candidate, and could become

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:44,480
the first human anti-aging pill. 3. Stem cells. Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,440
various places in the body, and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,560
But they decline as we age, and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break.

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,720
In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started

52
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,520
to develop diseases. So they took stem cells from baby mice brains, and injected them directly into

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,360
the brains of middle-aged mice. More specifically, the hypothalamus, a part that's involved in

54
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,440
regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,200
secreting micro-RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After four months, brain and muscles

56
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,920
worked better than those of untreated mice, and on average, they lived 10% longer. Another study

57
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,880
took stem cells from mice embryos, and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.

58
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,560
As a consequence, they had improved heart function,

59
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,840
could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough, their hair regrew faster.

60
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,000
What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,120
It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells

62
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap,

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.

64
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,440
This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.

65
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent,

66
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,760
but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own health span,

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,120
we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now,

68
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of health span extension needs more

69
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,480
attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain.
