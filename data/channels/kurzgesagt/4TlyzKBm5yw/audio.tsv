0	4400	Space, but without a spacesuit. A horrifying scenario.
4400	7400	First, the gases in your lungs and bloodstream expand.
7400	12200	Water will begin to boil and evaporate throughout your body, causing your skin and organs to stretch.
12200	17400	As your body swells, your circuitry system is still strong enough to keep your blood pressurized a bit longer.
17400	21800	It also provides enough oxygen for your brain to remain conscious for about 15 seconds.
21800	25000	However, within two minutes, you'll most likely die of asphyxiation.
25000	29400	If there are stars nearby, unfiltered solar radiation turns your dead body into a crisp.
29400	34400	However, in cold, deep space far away from stars, your body won't freeze immediately.
34400	40800	Thanks to the vacuum of space, you won't lose heat via convection or conduction, so it takes some time to get frozen.
40800	46800	Without oxygen and water and under extreme temperatures, your lifeless body wouldn't decompose the way it does on Earth,
46800	51000	and you could float unchanged through the emptiness of space for millions of years.
51000	54000	All in all, it's safe to say it's not a good idea to be in.
