00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Space, but without a spacesuit. A horrifying scenario.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.400
First, the gases in your lungs and bloodstream expand.

00:07.400 --> 00:12.200
Water will begin to boil and evaporate throughout your body, causing your skin and organs to stretch.

00:12.200 --> 00:17.400
As your body swells, your circuitry system is still strong enough to keep your blood pressurized a bit longer.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.800
It also provides enough oxygen for your brain to remain conscious for about 15 seconds.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.000
However, within two minutes, you'll most likely die of asphyxiation.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.400
If there are stars nearby, unfiltered solar radiation turns your dead body into a crisp.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.400
However, in cold, deep space far away from stars, your body won't freeze immediately.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.800
Thanks to the vacuum of space, you won't lose heat via convection or conduction, so it takes some time to get frozen.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.800
Without oxygen and water and under extreme temperatures, your lifeless body wouldn't decompose the way it does on Earth,

00:46.800 --> 00:51.000
and you could float unchanged through the emptiness of space for millions of years.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
All in all, it's safe to say it's not a good idea to be in.
