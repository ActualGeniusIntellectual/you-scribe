1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Space, but without a spacesuit. A horrifying scenario.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,400
First, the gases in your lungs and bloodstream expand.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Water will begin to boil and evaporate throughout your body, causing your skin and organs to stretch.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,400
As your body swells, your circuitry system is still strong enough to keep your blood pressurized a bit longer.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,800
It also provides enough oxygen for your brain to remain conscious for about 15 seconds.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,000
However, within two minutes, you'll most likely die of asphyxiation.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,400
If there are stars nearby, unfiltered solar radiation turns your dead body into a crisp.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,400
However, in cold, deep space far away from stars, your body won't freeze immediately.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Thanks to the vacuum of space, you won't lose heat via convection or conduction, so it takes some time to get frozen.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Without oxygen and water and under extreme temperatures, your lifeless body wouldn't decompose the way it does on Earth,

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,000
and you could float unchanged through the emptiness of space for millions of years.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All in all, it's safe to say it's not a good idea to be in.
