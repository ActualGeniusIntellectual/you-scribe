0	6320	The ultimate fight. The most indestructible organism alive, versus the most daring.
6320	7920	Let's go.
7920	10680	First, the deep dive of doom.
10680	17760	We're approaching 1,000 atmospheres of pressure, only a fraction of Tardigrade's previous record, home turf.
17760	22480	Oh no, Bird seems to be having trouble with the diving gear. Close call here.
22480	25040	Next up, the temperature slide of terror.
25040	29360	While Bird jumps right into it, Tardigrade rolls itself into its durable tun form.
29360	35120	In this state, they can endure temperatures as low as minus 200 degrees Celsius and up to 85 degrees Celsius.
35120	38160	A tough competitor for our determined Bird.
38160	41120	Let's raise the stakes in the outer space odyssey.
41120	44640	Who can hold out longer in the radiation-heavy vacuum?
44640	50240	Still in its tun form, Tardigrade can survive this harsh environment with ease, without any food or water.
50240	52240	No chance this time for Bird.
52240	55680	The final boss is left, Savage Supernova.
55680	57600	But it seems there are no winners in...
