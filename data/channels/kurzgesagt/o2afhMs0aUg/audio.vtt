00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
The ultimate fight. The most indestructible organism alive, versus the most daring.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.920
Let's go.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.680
First, the deep dive of doom.

00:10.680 --> 00:17.760
We're approaching 1,000 atmospheres of pressure, only a fraction of Tardigrade's previous record, home turf.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.480
Oh no, Bird seems to be having trouble with the diving gear. Close call here.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.040
Next up, the temperature slide of terror.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.360
While Bird jumps right into it, Tardigrade rolls itself into its durable tun form.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.120
In this state, they can endure temperatures as low as minus 200 degrees Celsius and up to 85 degrees Celsius.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.160
A tough competitor for our determined Bird.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.120
Let's raise the stakes in the outer space odyssey.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.640
Who can hold out longer in the radiation-heavy vacuum?

00:44.640 --> 00:50.240
Still in its tun form, Tardigrade can survive this harsh environment with ease, without any food or water.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.240
No chance this time for Bird.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.680
The final boss is left, Savage Supernova.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.600
But it seems there are no winners in...
