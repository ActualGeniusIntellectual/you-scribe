1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
The ultimate fight. The most indestructible organism alive, versus the most daring.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's go.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,680
First, the deep dive of doom.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,760
We're approaching 1,000 atmospheres of pressure, only a fraction of Tardigrade's previous record, home turf.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,480
Oh no, Bird seems to be having trouble with the diving gear. Close call here.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,040
Next up, the temperature slide of terror.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,360
While Bird jumps right into it, Tardigrade rolls itself into its durable tun form.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,120
In this state, they can endure temperatures as low as minus 200 degrees Celsius and up to 85 degrees Celsius.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,160
A tough competitor for our determined Bird.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Let's raise the stakes in the outer space odyssey.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,640
Who can hold out longer in the radiation-heavy vacuum?

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,240
Still in its tun form, Tardigrade can survive this harsh environment with ease, without any food or water.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,240
No chance this time for Bird.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,680
The final boss is left, Savage Supernova.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
But it seems there are no winners in...
