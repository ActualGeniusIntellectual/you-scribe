0	2720	Look around the room you're sitting in right now.
2720	5760	Let's fill it top to bottom with trillions of grains of sand,
5760	8400	billions of grains of rice, hundreds of thousands
8400	10540	of grapes, a few thousand apples,
10540	12300	and a dozen watermelons.
12300	15740	This is what the inside of your cells looks like.
15740	17380	In terms of numbers, they're mostly
17380	20640	filled up with water molecules, the grains of sand.
20640	23980	Water gives the cells insides the consistency of soft jelly
23980	27000	and enables other things to move around easily.
27000	29720	Almost all the other things, the rice and fruit,
29720	32560	are proteins, several billion in total,
32560	34720	more than 10,000 different kinds,
34720	37000	depending on the function of the cell.
37000	41560	Your cells are basically protein robots, as is all life, really.
41560	44600	In fact, all solid non-fat parts of your body
44600	47880	are mostly made out of protein, even your bones.
47880	51400	Proteins are dead things that make life happen.
51400	53360	How does this work?
53360	55480	The language of life.
55480	59200	Cells need to do many very hard things to stay alive.
59200	63520	Get food in and waste out, grow and build structures,
63520	66000	escape danger or react to stimuli,
66000	68600	make copies of themselves, and so on.
68600	72000	All of this is done by speaking the language of life.
72000	74960	And the words of this language are proteins.
74960	78320	This is how this language works in a nutshell.
78320	82440	It all begins with amino acids, tiny organic molecules.
82440	85240	They're the alphabet of the language of life.
85240	88560	There are 21 different ones, like different letters.
88560	92920	Amino acid A, amino acid B, C, and so on.
92920	95520	If you put around 50 amino acids together,
95520	99640	they form a protein, which, in the language of life, is a word.
99640	102320	And if you put many of these protein words together,
102320	106280	you get a sentence called a biological pathway.
106280	108840	Let's oversimplify a bit and say, for example,
108840	110680	your cell needs to break down sugar
110680	112200	with the language of life.
112200	114400	It may take the amino acids for the letters
114440	120360	B, R, E, A, and K to form the protein word break.
120360	123240	Then combine this word with other protein words
123240	126160	to form a biological pathway sentence that
126160	129000	means break down sugar.
129000	130800	In reality, this language of life
130800	134120	is so complex that it defies imagination.
134120	136040	You need to know about 8,000 words
136040	138160	to speak a human language really well.
138160	142120	But in the language of life, there are an estimated 20,000.
142160	144960	And while the average English word has five letters,
144960	149640	human proteins have an average of 375 amino acids.
149640	153920	The longest protein has more than 30,000.
153920	156040	And cells need to execute thousands
156040	157960	of steps at any moment.
157960	161760	If they ever stop speaking the language of life, they die.
161760	166360	OK, but how do mindless cells speak a language this complex?
166360	168720	Let's dive a little deeper.
168720	170560	There are 21 amino acids that can
170560	172920	be combined to form proteins.
172920	175200	And proteins are made up of dozens to hundreds
175200	177480	to thousands of amino acids.
177480	180960	For the average protein length of a human cell of 375
180960	184600	amino acids, you get a stunning 6.8 times 10
184600	189320	to the power of 495 possible proteins your cells can make,
189320	193520	a quadrillion googol, googol, googol, googol times more
193520	196440	than there are atoms in the universe.
196440	199000	Most of these possible proteins are useless.
199000	201440	Just like with human language, most random letter
201440	203400	combinations are just gibberish.
203400	206000	So you need to know which words, which proteins,
206000	209000	make up a language to speak it properly.
209000	212240	And this is the job of your DNA, a long sequence
212240	214360	of instructions.
214360	216520	If you untangle the cell's DNA, it
216520	218520	would be about two meters long.
218520	221480	All of your body's DNA combined into one long string
221480	224960	would reach to the sun and back over 20 times.
224960	228120	Around 1% of your DNA is made up of genes,
228120	230160	which are basically protein dictionaries that
230160	232320	contain all the words of the language of life
232320	234040	your cells speak.
234040	236080	But genes are also the building manuals
236080	239360	for all the proteins your cells need to function.
239360	242080	The rest of your DNA is probably not useless,
242080	244400	but basically like a set of rules.
244400	247320	It's like the book of grammar of the language of life.
247320	250360	Which proteins need to be built at which time?
250360	252320	How many of them do you need?
252320	255600	Which protein words go together and why?
255600	260640	OK, letters, words, sentences, dictionary, and grammar.
260640	263360	But of course, this is all just a metaphor for something
263360	265560	mind-numbingly complex.
265560	270080	Let's dive a little deeper to catch a glimpse of reality.
270080	273080	How dead proteins make life.
273080	275200	Now that we have some basic principles,
275200	277960	we have a chance to understand how dead things make life
277960	279040	together.
279040	281160	And for that, we need a fundamental force
281160	284360	of the universe, electromagnetism.
284360	286080	The elementary particles that make up
286080	288280	atoms, which make up amino acids,
288280	291880	have different charges that attract or repel each other.
291880	295080	The 21 different amino acids all have slightly different
295080	296360	charges.
296360	300120	Some are more negative, others more positive.
300120	302040	When your cells build proteins, they
302040	304600	put different amino acids together in chains,
304600	306560	basically long strings.
306560	309120	Now because of the different charges of the amino acids
309120	312680	used, these strings begin to fold in on themselves.
312680	314840	This folding process is so complex
314840	316680	that we still haven't completely understood
316680	318360	how exactly it works.
318360	323360	But in a nutshell, 1D strings become 3D structures.
323360	326240	Proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces
326240	328360	with a very specific shape.
328360	331360	In the world of proteins, shape is everything.
331360	334240	Because its 3D shape determines which areas of a protein
334240	336520	are charged in which way, and this
336520	340080	determines how it can interact with other proteins.
340080	342400	All of these differently charged puzzle pieces
342400	345320	can snap together or repel each other.
345320	347200	When they snap together, their charge
347200	350280	changes, which can make them change their shape, which then
350280	354920	makes them a new protein, a new tool that can do new things.
354920	358280	This is what makes proteins so incredibly powerful.
358280	360720	You can do basically everything with them.
360720	362920	They can snap together like LEGO pieces
362920	364880	to build complex structures.
364880	366720	They can dismantle things.
366720	368960	They can form complex micro machines
368960	371480	that use energy to do work.
371480	375240	And maybe most stunningly, they can convey information.
375240	378400	Let's say there's a toxic chemical entering your cell.
378400	381640	There may be a protein shaped to snap to that toxin.
381640	385400	If the protein finds that toxin, it changes its shape.
385400	388520	With that new shape, it can now snap into a different protein
388520	390400	that changes its shape again.
390400	392840	This new protein activates a micro machine
392840	395560	that directly binds to your DNA to order
395560	397880	the production of a special protein which acts
397880	400120	as an antidote to the toxin.
400120	402640	This cascade of interaction is the pathway
402640	404760	we spoke about earlier, a sentence
404760	406960	in the language of life.
406960	409240	So without a single active thought,
409240	413040	proteins have fixed a problem and saved the cell's life.
413040	415040	In reality, these pathways can have
415040	417760	dozens to hundreds of steps.
417760	421720	How life operates is so incredibly awe inducing.
421720	424640	Somehow, mind numbingly complex interactions
424640	428640	between dumb and dead proteins create a less dumb and less
428640	429960	dead cell.
429960	432600	Somewhere around here, life happens.
432600	435720	But we still don't know what life is.
435720	438800	How dumb things are smart together.
438800	440280	We need another analogy.
440280	442160	So let's talk about ants.
442160	444800	Ants share a fundamental property with cells.
444800	446520	They are really dumb.
446520	449320	A single ant will just stumble around uselessly.
449320	451120	But if you put a lot of ants together,
451120	454280	they exchange information and do amazing things.
454280	457560	Constructing complex structures, organizing themselves,
457560	460560	caring for broods, or attacking enemies.
460560	463200	Although dumb individually, together they
463200	465200	become something greater.
465200	469440	This phenomenon occurs all over nature and is called emergence.
469440	471080	It's the observation that entities
471080	475520	have properties and abilities that their parts do not have.
475520	478120	This is how everything in your body works.
478120	482120	Your cells are bags of proteins guided by chemistry.
482120	484160	But together, these proteins form
484160	488520	a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated things.
488520	492240	Cells are mindless robots that are even dumber than ants.
492240	495200	But many of them acting together form specialized tissue
495200	498600	and organ systems, from muscles that make your heartbeat
498600	501360	to brain cells that make you think.
501360	504040	If you look outside at the incredible dimension
504040	508400	and scale of space, a place where forever is a real thing,
508400	511600	it's almost impossible not to feel a bit small.
511600	513120	Not special.
513120	515920	But if you look inside into what you really are,
515920	519600	you just discover almost indescribable complexity,
519600	524160	the beautiful language of life.
524160	527720	Almost everything in the universe reveals hidden layers of complexity
527720	531440	if you look closer and if you have the knowledge to understand it.
