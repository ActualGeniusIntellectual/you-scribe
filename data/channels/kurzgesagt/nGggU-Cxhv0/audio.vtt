00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
Your tattoos are inside your immune system, literally.

00:04.500 --> 00:12.000
With each very tasteful piece of art, you kickstart a drama with millions of deaths, grand sacrifices,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.500
and your immune system stepping in to protect you from yourself.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.500
Let's give you a tattoo and zoom in to see what happens inside your skin.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.500
The conveyor belt of death.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
Your skin has to solve a huge problem.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.500
It's your largest organ and has the most direct contact with the world around you.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.000
Trillions of microbes, dirt, insects, and vermin can't be allowed to get inside you,

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
but your skin is also constantly damaged by you moving through the world.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.500
Your body solved this by making your skin a conveyor belt of death.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.000
All the skin you see is actually dead stuff.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.500
The alive part of your skin cells begins around 1mm deep in the skin industrial complex.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
Stem cells constantly clone themselves,

01:00.500 --> 01:04.500
producing new skin cells that begin a journey from the inside to the outside.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.000
Each new generation pushes the older ones further up.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.500
As your skin cells mature, they interlock with each other and produce lamellar bodies,

01:13.500 --> 01:19.000
tiny bags that squirt out fat to create a waterproof coat that closes any gaps between them.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.500
And then they dry out and kill themselves, merging together into inseparable lumps.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.000
This wall of dead corpses is consistently pushed upwards.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Up to 50 layers of dead cells cover your whole body and are constantly replaced by new cells moving up.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Every hour, you shed around 200 million dead skin cells and all the dirt or bacteria that are stuck to them.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Tattooing this part of your skin would be useless as nothing would stick around.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
We need to go deeper.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
When the fleshy world explodes, below the conveyor belt of death lies the dermis.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.500
It's full of structural tissue and cells, tiny blood vessels, sensory cells that report to nerve endings,

02:00.500 --> 02:04.500
the roots of your hairs, sweat glands regulating your temperature,

02:04.500 --> 02:10.500
and of course loads of immune cells guarding your flesh right below the moving border wall.

02:10.500 --> 02:14.500
This region and below is where your new tattoo will go.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
Okay, ready?

02:16.500 --> 02:18.500
The world explodes.

02:18.500 --> 02:25.500
Half a dozen monoliths the size of skyscrapers slam through the 50 layers of dead cells deep into the dermis,

02:25.500 --> 02:32.500
ripping huge holes into the skin, only to retreat and smash through the tissue again about twice a second.

02:32.500 --> 02:39.000
Tens of thousands of cells are violently killed right away, ripped into pieces, or damaged beyond repair.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Luckily, you did your research and chose a responsible tattoo artist who properly disinfected their tools and your skin.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
But you only ever get 99.9% of all bacteria, and some of the survivors made it into your flesh.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
To put it mildly, your immune system is not amused at all.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
All the death and destruction wakes up hundreds of thousands of macrophages in your dermis that rush into the open wounds to defend you.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Immediately they start killing bacteria, release chemicals that call for reinforcements,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
and order your blood vessels to open up and make your dermis swell up with fluid.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
But worse than the hundreds of wounds and a few invaders is the tidal wave of chemicals that flood your tissue.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
Tattoo ink can be made from hundreds of substances, some may even be toxic or carcinogenic.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Most are from heavy metals like lead, nickel, or chromium dissolved in distilled water.

03:30.000 --> 03:39.000
The battlefield is now a wild mix of dead cell parts, a few panicked bacteria, blood and bodily fluids, platelet cells trying to close wounds,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
more and more fresh immune cells, and the flood of tattoo ink.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
On the scale of your cells, clumps of ink particles are huge.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
If you were the size of a cell, they'd range from big dogs to small office buildings.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
Your immune system has one main job, identify what is not you and smash it until it's dead.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
The macrophages are desperately trying to do that.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Like tiny octopuses, they extend arm-like structures and begin pulling the ink particles inside.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Usually when a macrophage has eaten an enemy, it showers it in acid to dissolve it.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But this doesn't work with the ink.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
They try and try, but nothing works. The particles don't react in any way.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And this is just the particles small enough to be devoured.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
By now, the larger chunks are surrounded by thousands of your structural skin cells and macrophages that are gnoming on them,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
bathing them in acid and attack chemicals, trying to destroy and kill them.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
But they're not moving even a tiny bit. Nothing works.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Finally, your immune system has to concede.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
It will not win this fight, so it does the next best thing, not lose.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Your cells don't know how dangerous these metals and chemicals are, but they can at least not let them spread around.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So they just stay in place.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
They vacuum up all the particles they can fit into their bodies and surround the larger ones,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
trapping them in the only prison they can build themselves.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
Bit by bit, the ink inside thousands of tiny wounds moves inside millions of immune cells that freeze in place forever.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
On the outside, you don't notice any of this.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Your new tattoo is fresh and the colors are vibrant.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
Your skin hurts and is irritated and swollen, but wounds heal, tiny holes close, dead cells are replaced.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
Bit by bit, the conveyor belt of death does its job, shedding dead cells ripe in color, replacing them with fresh and clean ones.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Your tattoo becomes a little less vibrant now the ink is no longer on your skin, but inside it.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
But what you're really seeing is millions of your macrophages sitting in your dermis, patiently holding the ink in place, protecting your body from poison.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Your immune system is why your tattoo is forever.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Actually, nothing is forever.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Over time, your macrophages get old and die, and new ones come in to gobble up the ink and keep it in place.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
But sometimes, a tiny bit of ink escapes.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Most of it is recaptured and locked in place, but not always the exact same place.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
You notice that as your tattoo fades out a bit and turns less sharp and crisp at its edges.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Some of the ink escapes the tattoo entirely.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
It rides fluids flowing from your tissue and spreads around your body, another reason why tattoo ink should ideally not be poison.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Your immune system also kind of doesn't want you to remove tattoos.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
To do that, usually the ink is shot at with lasers, which heats up particles until they break into smaller chunks, cooking your brave macrophages in the process.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
With every round of lasering, more of your tattoo is broken down and carried away by fluids.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
But also, every time, new macrophages rush into the tattoo to lock the ink in place.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
So like, hmm, maybe think about it carefully before you get the name of your new bae tattooed, but you do you.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
But if you got one, you can directly see your immune system protecting you.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
This is how much your body loves you, which is kind of sweet.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
And while tattoos are probably not that big of a deal for your body if applied correctly, you now know about the struggle going on inside your skin,

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
and the sacrifice of your macrophage buddies, only for you to have that art forever.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
To appreciate your amazing immune system, you have to know about it first, and the same goes for anything going on in our universe.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
To help you with that, we've created a series of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the next level.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
Made in collaboration with our friends at Brilliant.org, these lessons let you further explore the topics in our most popular videos,

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
from rabies and mammalian metabolism to climate science and supernovae.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
Brilliant has thousands of lessons to explore, and each one is interactive, like a one-on-one version of a Kurzgesagt video.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Brilliant's latest course, How LLMs Work, takes you under the hood of real language models.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
It demystifies technologies like ChatGPT, with interactive lessons on everything from how models build vocabulary to how they choose their next word.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
You'll learn how to tune LLMs to produce output with exactly your desired tonality, whether it's poetry or a cover letter.

08:12.000 --> 08:21.000
And you'll understand why training is really everything, by comparing models trained on Taylor Swift lyrics and the legal speech of Big Tech's terms and conditions.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
This isn't just another course, it's an immersive AI workshop, allowing you to experience and harness the mechanics of today's most advanced tool.

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
