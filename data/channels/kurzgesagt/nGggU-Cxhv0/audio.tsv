0	4500	Your tattoos are inside your immune system, literally.
4500	12000	With each very tasteful piece of art, you kickstart a drama with millions of deaths, grand sacrifices,
12000	16500	and your immune system stepping in to protect you from yourself.
16500	21500	Let's give you a tattoo and zoom in to see what happens inside your skin.
21500	24500	The conveyor belt of death.
24500	28000	Your skin has to solve a huge problem.
28000	32500	It's your largest organ and has the most direct contact with the world around you.
32500	38000	Trillions of microbes, dirt, insects, and vermin can't be allowed to get inside you,
38000	43000	but your skin is also constantly damaged by you moving through the world.
43000	47500	Your body solved this by making your skin a conveyor belt of death.
47500	51000	All the skin you see is actually dead stuff.
51000	57500	The alive part of your skin cells begins around 1mm deep in the skin industrial complex.
57500	60500	Stem cells constantly clone themselves,
60500	64500	producing new skin cells that begin a journey from the inside to the outside.
64500	68000	Each new generation pushes the older ones further up.
68000	73500	As your skin cells mature, they interlock with each other and produce lamellar bodies,
73500	79000	tiny bags that squirt out fat to create a waterproof coat that closes any gaps between them.
79000	84500	And then they dry out and kill themselves, merging together into inseparable lumps.
84500	89000	This wall of dead corpses is consistently pushed upwards.
89000	95000	Up to 50 layers of dead cells cover your whole body and are constantly replaced by new cells moving up.
95000	102000	Every hour, you shed around 200 million dead skin cells and all the dirt or bacteria that are stuck to them.
102000	107000	Tattooing this part of your skin would be useless as nothing would stick around.
107000	109000	We need to go deeper.
109000	115000	When the fleshy world explodes, below the conveyor belt of death lies the dermis.
115000	120500	It's full of structural tissue and cells, tiny blood vessels, sensory cells that report to nerve endings,
120500	124500	the roots of your hairs, sweat glands regulating your temperature,
124500	130500	and of course loads of immune cells guarding your flesh right below the moving border wall.
130500	134500	This region and below is where your new tattoo will go.
134500	136500	Okay, ready?
136500	138500	The world explodes.
138500	145500	Half a dozen monoliths the size of skyscrapers slam through the 50 layers of dead cells deep into the dermis,
145500	152500	ripping huge holes into the skin, only to retreat and smash through the tissue again about twice a second.
152500	159000	Tens of thousands of cells are violently killed right away, ripped into pieces, or damaged beyond repair.
159000	166000	Luckily, you did your research and chose a responsible tattoo artist who properly disinfected their tools and your skin.
166000	173000	But you only ever get 99.9% of all bacteria, and some of the survivors made it into your flesh.
173000	177000	To put it mildly, your immune system is not amused at all.
177000	184000	All the death and destruction wakes up hundreds of thousands of macrophages in your dermis that rush into the open wounds to defend you.
184000	189000	Immediately they start killing bacteria, release chemicals that call for reinforcements,
189000	193000	and order your blood vessels to open up and make your dermis swell up with fluid.
193000	199000	But worse than the hundreds of wounds and a few invaders is the tidal wave of chemicals that flood your tissue.
199000	205000	Tattoo ink can be made from hundreds of substances, some may even be toxic or carcinogenic.
205000	210000	Most are from heavy metals like lead, nickel, or chromium dissolved in distilled water.
210000	219000	The battlefield is now a wild mix of dead cell parts, a few panicked bacteria, blood and bodily fluids, platelet cells trying to close wounds,
219000	223000	more and more fresh immune cells, and the flood of tattoo ink.
223000	227000	On the scale of your cells, clumps of ink particles are huge.
227000	233000	If you were the size of a cell, they'd range from big dogs to small office buildings.
233000	240000	Your immune system has one main job, identify what is not you and smash it until it's dead.
240000	243000	The macrophages are desperately trying to do that.
243000	249000	Like tiny octopuses, they extend arm-like structures and begin pulling the ink particles inside.
249000	254000	Usually when a macrophage has eaten an enemy, it showers it in acid to dissolve it.
254000	256000	But this doesn't work with the ink.
256000	261000	They try and try, but nothing works. The particles don't react in any way.
261000	264000	And this is just the particles small enough to be devoured.
264000	271000	By now, the larger chunks are surrounded by thousands of your structural skin cells and macrophages that are gnoming on them,
271000	275000	bathing them in acid and attack chemicals, trying to destroy and kill them.
275000	280000	But they're not moving even a tiny bit. Nothing works.
280000	283000	Finally, your immune system has to concede.
283000	287000	It will not win this fight, so it does the next best thing, not lose.
287000	293000	Your cells don't know how dangerous these metals and chemicals are, but they can at least not let them spread around.
293000	295000	So they just stay in place.
295000	300000	They vacuum up all the particles they can fit into their bodies and surround the larger ones,
300000	304000	trapping them in the only prison they can build themselves.
304000	311000	Bit by bit, the ink inside thousands of tiny wounds moves inside millions of immune cells that freeze in place forever.
311000	314000	On the outside, you don't notice any of this.
314000	317000	Your new tattoo is fresh and the colors are vibrant.
317000	324000	Your skin hurts and is irritated and swollen, but wounds heal, tiny holes close, dead cells are replaced.
324000	332000	Bit by bit, the conveyor belt of death does its job, shedding dead cells ripe in color, replacing them with fresh and clean ones.
332000	338000	Your tattoo becomes a little less vibrant now the ink is no longer on your skin, but inside it.
338000	346000	But what you're really seeing is millions of your macrophages sitting in your dermis, patiently holding the ink in place, protecting your body from poison.
346000	350000	Your immune system is why your tattoo is forever.
350000	353000	Actually, nothing is forever.
353000	359000	Over time, your macrophages get old and die, and new ones come in to gobble up the ink and keep it in place.
359000	362000	But sometimes, a tiny bit of ink escapes.
362000	367000	Most of it is recaptured and locked in place, but not always the exact same place.
367000	373000	You notice that as your tattoo fades out a bit and turns less sharp and crisp at its edges.
373000	376000	Some of the ink escapes the tattoo entirely.
376000	384000	It rides fluids flowing from your tissue and spreads around your body, another reason why tattoo ink should ideally not be poison.
384000	388000	Your immune system also kind of doesn't want you to remove tattoos.
388000	396000	To do that, usually the ink is shot at with lasers, which heats up particles until they break into smaller chunks, cooking your brave macrophages in the process.
396000	401000	With every round of lasering, more of your tattoo is broken down and carried away by fluids.
401000	406000	But also, every time, new macrophages rush into the tattoo to lock the ink in place.
406000	413000	So like, hmm, maybe think about it carefully before you get the name of your new bae tattooed, but you do you.
413000	418000	But if you got one, you can directly see your immune system protecting you.
418000	422000	This is how much your body loves you, which is kind of sweet.
422000	430000	And while tattoos are probably not that big of a deal for your body if applied correctly, you now know about the struggle going on inside your skin,
430000	436000	and the sacrifice of your macrophage buddies, only for you to have that art forever.
438000	445000	To appreciate your amazing immune system, you have to know about it first, and the same goes for anything going on in our universe.
445000	451000	To help you with that, we've created a series of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the next level.
