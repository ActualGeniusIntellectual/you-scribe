1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Your tattoos are inside your immune system, literally.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:12,000
With each very tasteful piece of art, you kickstart a drama with millions of deaths, grand sacrifices,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,500
and your immune system stepping in to protect you from yourself.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Let's give you a tattoo and zoom in to see what happens inside your skin.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
The conveyor belt of death.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Your skin has to solve a huge problem.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,500
It's your largest organ and has the most direct contact with the world around you.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Trillions of microbes, dirt, insects, and vermin can't be allowed to get inside you,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but your skin is also constantly damaged by you moving through the world.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Your body solved this by making your skin a conveyor belt of death.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,000
All the skin you see is actually dead stuff.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,500
The alive part of your skin cells begins around 1mm deep in the skin industrial complex.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Stem cells constantly clone themselves,

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
producing new skin cells that begin a journey from the inside to the outside.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Each new generation pushes the older ones further up.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,500
As your skin cells mature, they interlock with each other and produce lamellar bodies,

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,000
tiny bags that squirt out fat to create a waterproof coat that closes any gaps between them.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,500
And then they dry out and kill themselves, merging together into inseparable lumps.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,000
This wall of dead corpses is consistently pushed upwards.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Up to 50 layers of dead cells cover your whole body and are constantly replaced by new cells moving up.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Every hour, you shed around 200 million dead skin cells and all the dirt or bacteria that are stuck to them.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Tattooing this part of your skin would be useless as nothing would stick around.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We need to go deeper.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When the fleshy world explodes, below the conveyor belt of death lies the dermis.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,500
It's full of structural tissue and cells, tiny blood vessels, sensory cells that report to nerve endings,

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
the roots of your hairs, sweat glands regulating your temperature,

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
and of course loads of immune cells guarding your flesh right below the moving border wall.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
This region and below is where your new tattoo will go.

29
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Okay, ready?

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
The world explodes.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Half a dozen monoliths the size of skyscrapers slam through the 50 layers of dead cells deep into the dermis,

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,500
ripping huge holes into the skin, only to retreat and smash through the tissue again about twice a second.

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
Tens of thousands of cells are violently killed right away, ripped into pieces, or damaged beyond repair.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Luckily, you did your research and chose a responsible tattoo artist who properly disinfected their tools and your skin.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But you only ever get 99.9% of all bacteria, and some of the survivors made it into your flesh.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
To put it mildly, your immune system is not amused at all.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All the death and destruction wakes up hundreds of thousands of macrophages in your dermis that rush into the open wounds to defend you.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Immediately they start killing bacteria, release chemicals that call for reinforcements,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and order your blood vessels to open up and make your dermis swell up with fluid.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But worse than the hundreds of wounds and a few invaders is the tidal wave of chemicals that flood your tissue.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tattoo ink can be made from hundreds of substances, some may even be toxic or carcinogenic.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Most are from heavy metals like lead, nickel, or chromium dissolved in distilled water.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The battlefield is now a wild mix of dead cell parts, a few panicked bacteria, blood and bodily fluids, platelet cells trying to close wounds,

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
more and more fresh immune cells, and the flood of tattoo ink.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
On the scale of your cells, clumps of ink particles are huge.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you were the size of a cell, they'd range from big dogs to small office buildings.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your immune system has one main job, identify what is not you and smash it until it's dead.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The macrophages are desperately trying to do that.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Like tiny octopuses, they extend arm-like structures and begin pulling the ink particles inside.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Usually when a macrophage has eaten an enemy, it showers it in acid to dissolve it.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But this doesn't work with the ink.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They try and try, but nothing works. The particles don't react in any way.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And this is just the particles small enough to be devoured.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
By now, the larger chunks are surrounded by thousands of your structural skin cells and macrophages that are gnoming on them,

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
bathing them in acid and attack chemicals, trying to destroy and kill them.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But they're not moving even a tiny bit. Nothing works.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Finally, your immune system has to concede.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It will not win this fight, so it does the next best thing, not lose.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Your cells don't know how dangerous these metals and chemicals are, but they can at least not let them spread around.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So they just stay in place.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They vacuum up all the particles they can fit into their bodies and surround the larger ones,

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
trapping them in the only prison they can build themselves.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Bit by bit, the ink inside thousands of tiny wounds moves inside millions of immune cells that freeze in place forever.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
On the outside, you don't notice any of this.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your new tattoo is fresh and the colors are vibrant.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your skin hurts and is irritated and swollen, but wounds heal, tiny holes close, dead cells are replaced.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Bit by bit, the conveyor belt of death does its job, shedding dead cells ripe in color, replacing them with fresh and clean ones.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Your tattoo becomes a little less vibrant now the ink is no longer on your skin, but inside it.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But what you're really seeing is millions of your macrophages sitting in your dermis, patiently holding the ink in place, protecting your body from poison.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your immune system is why your tattoo is forever.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Actually, nothing is forever.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Over time, your macrophages get old and die, and new ones come in to gobble up the ink and keep it in place.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But sometimes, a tiny bit of ink escapes.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Most of it is recaptured and locked in place, but not always the exact same place.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You notice that as your tattoo fades out a bit and turns less sharp and crisp at its edges.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Some of the ink escapes the tattoo entirely.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It rides fluids flowing from your tissue and spreads around your body, another reason why tattoo ink should ideally not be poison.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Your immune system also kind of doesn't want you to remove tattoos.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To do that, usually the ink is shot at with lasers, which heats up particles until they break into smaller chunks, cooking your brave macrophages in the process.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
With every round of lasering, more of your tattoo is broken down and carried away by fluids.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But also, every time, new macrophages rush into the tattoo to lock the ink in place.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So like, hmm, maybe think about it carefully before you get the name of your new bae tattooed, but you do you.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But if you got one, you can directly see your immune system protecting you.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is how much your body loves you, which is kind of sweet.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And while tattoos are probably not that big of a deal for your body if applied correctly, you now know about the struggle going on inside your skin,

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and the sacrifice of your macrophage buddies, only for you to have that art forever.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
To appreciate your amazing immune system, you have to know about it first, and the same goes for anything going on in our universe.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To help you with that, we've created a series of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the next level.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Made in collaboration with our friends at Brilliant.org, these lessons let you further explore the topics in our most popular videos,

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
from rabies and mammalian metabolism to climate science and supernovae.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Brilliant has thousands of lessons to explore, and each one is interactive, like a one-on-one version of a Kurzgesagt video.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Brilliant's latest course, How LLMs Work, takes you under the hood of real language models.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It demystifies technologies like ChatGPT, with interactive lessons on everything from how models build vocabulary to how they choose their next word.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You'll learn how to tune LLMs to produce output with exactly your desired tonality, whether it's poetry or a cover letter.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And you'll understand why training is really everything, by comparing models trained on Taylor Swift lyrics and the legal speech of Big Tech's terms and conditions.

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This isn't just another course, it's an immersive AI workshop, allowing you to experience and harness the mechanics of today's most advanced tool.
