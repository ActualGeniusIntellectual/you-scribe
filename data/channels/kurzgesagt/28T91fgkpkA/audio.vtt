00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
How many moons could Earth handle?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
The main factor is space.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Any moon needs a clean orbit and we have to take two things into account.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
One, it can't be too far, otherwise it won't follow a stable orbit around us.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Two, it can't be too close either or the gravitational pull of Earth will grind it into crumbs.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
These outer and inner limits define our moon zone.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
A donut shaped area where any additional moon will have to live.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Each moon around the Earth requires its own personal sub-moon zone.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
And these zones shouldn't interact with each other.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Like runners on an Olympic race track, they need to be spaced out so that their mutual influence is kept to a minimum.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
The bigger the mass of a moon, the larger the personal space required.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
All in all, simulations have shown that only a few constellations would be stable.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Earth could either host up to seven moons as big as dwarf planet Ceres,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
four Pluto-sized moons, or three Moon-sized moons.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
And then what? Tides might be more violent, there could be different calendar systems,

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
and most notably, on some nights our sky would be adorned with three bright marbles,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
frequently casting beautiful shadows on each other.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Wow, what a view! Butâ€¦
