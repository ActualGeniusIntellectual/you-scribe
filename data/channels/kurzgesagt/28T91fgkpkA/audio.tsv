0	2000	How many moons could Earth handle?
2000	4000	The main factor is space.
4000	7000	Any moon needs a clean orbit and we have to take two things into account.
7000	11000	One, it can't be too far, otherwise it won't follow a stable orbit around us.
11000	15000	Two, it can't be too close either or the gravitational pull of Earth will grind it into crumbs.
15000	18000	These outer and inner limits define our moon zone.
18000	22000	A donut shaped area where any additional moon will have to live.
22000	25000	Each moon around the Earth requires its own personal sub-moon zone.
25000	27000	And these zones shouldn't interact with each other.
27000	32000	Like runners on an Olympic race track, they need to be spaced out so that their mutual influence is kept to a minimum.
32000	35000	The bigger the mass of a moon, the larger the personal space required.
35000	39000	All in all, simulations have shown that only a few constellations would be stable.
39000	42000	Earth could either host up to seven moons as big as dwarf planet Ceres,
42000	45000	four Pluto-sized moons, or three Moon-sized moons.
45000	49000	And then what? Tides might be more violent, there could be different calendar systems,
49000	54000	and most notably, on some nights our sky would be adorned with three bright marbles,
54000	56000	frequently casting beautiful shadows on each other.
56000	59000	Wow, what a view! Butâ€¦
