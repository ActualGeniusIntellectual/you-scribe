1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How many moons could Earth handle?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The main factor is space.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Any moon needs a clean orbit and we have to take two things into account.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One, it can't be too far, otherwise it won't follow a stable orbit around us.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Two, it can't be too close either or the gravitational pull of Earth will grind it into crumbs.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
These outer and inner limits define our moon zone.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A donut shaped area where any additional moon will have to live.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Each moon around the Earth requires its own personal sub-moon zone.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And these zones shouldn't interact with each other.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Like runners on an Olympic race track, they need to be spaced out so that their mutual influence is kept to a minimum.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The bigger the mass of a moon, the larger the personal space required.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All in all, simulations have shown that only a few constellations would be stable.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Earth could either host up to seven moons as big as dwarf planet Ceres,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
four Pluto-sized moons, or three Moon-sized moons.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And then what? Tides might be more violent, there could be different calendar systems,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and most notably, on some nights our sky would be adorned with three bright marbles,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
frequently casting beautiful shadows on each other.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Wow, what a view! Butâ€¦
