00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Earth's magnetic field is definitely going to flip.

00:03.040 --> 00:07.440
In Earth's 4.5 billion year history, the magnetic field has flipped many times.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.920
So, how do we know a flip is going to happen?

00:09.920 --> 00:12.160
First, the magnetic field weakens by about 90%.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.080
For us humans, this phase is much more dramatic than the actual flip.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.080
A weaker magnetic field means less protection from harmful space radiation.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.200
Communication satellites in higher orbits start to fail.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.080
GPS, banking and the stock exchange won't work anymore and the internet would be disrupted.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.760
On Earth, the probability of skin cancer increases and the internal compass of

00:31.760 --> 00:35.520
animals whose navigation depends on the magnetic field is impaired.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.480
This process can last several thousand years until magnetic north has become south and vice versa.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.800
It's not a doomsday scenario, but it's certainly a possibility that we need to be aware of.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.880
The good news, after every flip, the magnetic field stabilizes again.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.400
In the past, there was a magnetic pole flip about every 300,000 years

00:52.400 --> 00:55.520
and the last flip occurred 780,000 years ago.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.720
Although we don't know exactly when it will happen, we know that.
