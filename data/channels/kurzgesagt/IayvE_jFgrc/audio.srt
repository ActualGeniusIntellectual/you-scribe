1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Earth's magnetic field is definitely going to flip.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
In Earth's 4.5 billion year history, the magnetic field has flipped many times.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
So, how do we know a flip is going to happen?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
First, the magnetic field weakens by about 90%.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
For us humans, this phase is much more dramatic than the actual flip.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,080
A weaker magnetic field means less protection from harmful space radiation.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,200
Communication satellites in higher orbits start to fail.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,080
GPS, banking and the stock exchange won't work anymore and the internet would be disrupted.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
On Earth, the probability of skin cancer increases and the internal compass of

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
animals whose navigation depends on the magnetic field is impaired.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,480
This process can last several thousand years until magnetic north has become south and vice versa.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
It's not a doomsday scenario, but it's certainly a possibility that we need to be aware of.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,880
The good news, after every flip, the magnetic field stabilizes again.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,400
In the past, there was a magnetic pole flip about every 300,000 years

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,520
and the last flip occurred 780,000 years ago.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,720
Although we don't know exactly when it will happen, we know that.
