0	3040	Earth's magnetic field is definitely going to flip.
3040	7440	In Earth's 4.5 billion year history, the magnetic field has flipped many times.
7440	9920	So, how do we know a flip is going to happen?
9920	12160	First, the magnetic field weakens by about 90%.
12800	16080	For us humans, this phase is much more dramatic than the actual flip.
16080	20080	A weaker magnetic field means less protection from harmful space radiation.
20080	23200	Communication satellites in higher orbits start to fail.
23200	28080	GPS, banking and the stock exchange won't work anymore and the internet would be disrupted.
28080	31760	On Earth, the probability of skin cancer increases and the internal compass of
31760	35520	animals whose navigation depends on the magnetic field is impaired.
35520	40480	This process can last several thousand years until magnetic north has become south and vice versa.
40480	44800	It's not a doomsday scenario, but it's certainly a possibility that we need to be aware of.
44800	48880	The good news, after every flip, the magnetic field stabilizes again.
48880	52400	In the past, there was a magnetic pole flip about every 300,000 years
52400	55520	and the last flip occurred 780,000 years ago.
55520	58720	Although we don't know exactly when it will happen, we know that.
