4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,780
The universe is going to die one day, but how?

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,300
Well, it turns out our cosmic fate will be decided by a fight between two titans.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,220
The two warriors deciding the fate of the universe.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,920
Our universe was born 14 billion years ago in the Big Bang and has been expanding ever since.

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,100
For some reason, new empty space is being created out of nothing between galaxies.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,520
Space itself is becoming bigger. Will it go on forever, or will it stop one day?

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Today, we think the universe is at the mercy of two cosmic demigods fighting for dominance.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,640
The first one is all the stuff in the universe.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,060
Galaxies, gas, dark matter. While they're very different, they just want to do one thing, get together.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,440
Matter is attracted by matter, pulled together by gravity, and

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,920
gravity also pulls on the universe as a whole, slowing the expansion that started at the Big Bang.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,280
Our second warrior is empty space.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,160
While it seems, well, empty and powerless, empty space has an intrinsic energy.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,280
We don't really have an idea what this energy is or why it's there.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,880
It's really a placeholder that fills a blank in our understanding of reality, but it's got a cool name, dark energy.

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,560
Dark energy pushes things apart, a sort of anti-gravity that accelerates the cosmic expansion.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,000
So, we have all the matter in the universe pulling in, and empty space infused with dark energy pushing out.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,180
Whoever wins will kill the universe in fun ways.

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,080
But who will win? It all depends on the mysterious dark energy.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,420
Will its strength stay the same, a common assumption just because it keeps our models simple?

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,260
Or will it get weaker, or will it get more powerful over time?

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
One.

26
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,340
Constant dark energy, heat death.

27
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,660
If the strength of dark energy stays constant, it will win the war.

28
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,340
Since space is growing, matter is getting more and more diluted, like sugar in a cup being filled with more and more tea.

29
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,380
But as the universe expands, new empty space is created, which brings more dark energy,

30
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,740
which pushes everything apart even more, which creates more empty space, which makes the universe grow even faster.

31
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,360
A feedback loop that will make the universe expand at an exponential rate.

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,460
Every 12 billion years or so, it will double in diameter, forever.

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,100
But while dark energy is winning the war, matter is winning at least one battle.

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,860
At short distances, it can keep things together.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,220
Local galaxy bubbles can overcome the push of dark energy.

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,800
In a few billion years, our local group of galaxies will merge into a gigantic ball with trillions of stars.

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,000
It will soon become our last view of the cosmos.

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,480
All other galaxies will be pushed away by the expansion.

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,260
For us, it will look like the rest of the universe is rushing away, until in a few hundred billion years,

40
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
we won't see other galaxies at all.

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,600
We'll be alone, surrounded by a seemingly infinite dark void.

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
In about 100 trillion years, all the stars of our super galaxy will have died out.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,520
All gas that could create new stars has been consumed, and no new gas can come in.

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,320
The galaxy will be dark and filled with stellar corpses.

45
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,520
Over quadrillions of years, white dwarfs and neutron stars will slowly cool, until becoming truly dark,

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,280
turning off the last lights of the universe.

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
All structures, big and small, will slowly dissolve.

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:05,240
One by one, all dead stars and planets will leave the super galaxy, which slowly dissolves over six-dillions of years.

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,240
Every object will end up on its own, which means that dark energy takes over again,

50
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,360
creating more and more empty space between everything.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,760
Objects will be so far apart, that it will be as if each had a universe for itself.

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,860
Not much happens anymore, until in a good old years, all black holes will have evaporated.

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,980
In the end, entropy and dark energy won't stop until their job is finished.

54
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,360
Over time spans you might as well call, forever,

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,460
all remaining structures might even dissolve into single particles that will be pushed away from each other by an ever-growing empty space.

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,280
Imagine a whole universe, with just a single lonely particle, traveling through nothingness.

57
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,860
This is the final state, the true end, the big freeze, or heat death.

58
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,700
A completely featureless, cold, and eternally expanding universe.

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,060
Nothing will ever be able to happen again, forever.

60
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
That was a bummer, what else could happen?

61
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,400
Two, increasing dark energy, big rip.

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,980
What if dark energy gets stronger? In this case, empty space won't just win over matter,

63
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:23,420
it will literally rip it to pieces. In the big freeze scenario, matter lost the war, but won some battles.

64
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,060
But here, matter wins nothing.

65
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,000
Dark energy is growing stronger over time,

66
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,400
overcoming the pull of gravity, and creating new empty space at smaller and smaller distances.

67
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,820
In this scenario, things will escalate quickly. It could start as early as 20 billion years from now.

68
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,620
First, dark energy will create empty space between individual galaxies.

69
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,460
Our galaxy will leave its local cluster and begin to drift alone in a rapidly inflating and ever darker cosmos.

70
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,360
Some billion years later, empty space starts to push between individual stars,

71
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,140
dissolving the galaxy. If you live on a planet in a star system,

72
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,500
the night sky will start looking sad and gloomy, as other stars are pushed too far away to be seen.

73
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,060
A few million years after the sky turns dark, dark energy starts to create empty space inside star systems.

74
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,120
Your planet is pushed away from its star, and all life in the universe freezes to death.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,440
There's not much time left, as a few months later, dark energy is creating empty space inside solid objects.

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,880
Stars, neutron stars, planets, asteroids, everything solid, is being ripped into pieces.

77
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,400
If you're on a spaceship, you only have a short time before you are ripped apart.

78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,820
Half an hour later, even atoms are destroyed, as new space is being created so furiously that electrons and nuclei are separated.

79
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,740
Now the universe has just a fraction of a second left.

80
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,940
In this final moment, only dying black holes remain, drained and defeated by dark energy.

81
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:04,860
They're tiny, septillions of times smaller than an atom, and they explode with the power of a trillion supernovae in a trillionth of an octillionth of a second.

82
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,060
Finally, the very fabric of reality is torn to its core,

83
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,700
obliterating space-time itself. The big rip. Space and time have lost their meanings.

84
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,580
Making it impossible to predict what will happen next.

85
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,620
Ugh.

86
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,980
Three.

87
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,200
Decreasing dark energy. Big crunch.

88
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
Poor matter.

89
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,140
But there is one scenario where it wins. If the strength of dark energy decreases with time,

90
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:40,140
and if this reduction is strong enough, the pull of gravity will win, and all the things in existence will move towards each other.

91
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,780
Unfortunately, making the universe collapse into itself.

92
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,060
No one knows when this might begin, but it could be as soon as a few hundred million years.

93
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500
What will it look like?

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:59,300
As the universe begins to contract, over billions of years, galaxies and galaxy clusters approach each other until they eventually collide.

95
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,620
They're mostly made of empty space, so a collision is like the gentle merger of two clouds.

96
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,420
At any rate, first galaxies and later individual stars get closer and closer.

97
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,940
As the universe goes on collapsing, you might worry about stars and planets eventually crashing against each other.

98
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,820
This will happen, but it's not your worst problem.

99
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,540
If space itself shrinks, this also concentrates all the radiation emitted in the past by all the stars,

100
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,140
supernovae and quasars that ever existed. Now,

101
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,680
empty space is filled with radiation. The dark nothing between stars is heating up, making life unpleasant and then

102
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
impossible, as planets just burn.

103
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,260
Slowly at first, then rapidly, space gets as hot as it was after the Big Bang.

104
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,780
Stars are pretty hot, but now the space around them is hotter. They're literally boiled from the outside.

105
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,900
As the universe collapses into itself, all galaxies and all stars merge into a single ball of hot plasma.

106
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,620
The Big Crunch is complete.

107
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
From here on, there are two possibilities.

108
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:11,180
Either the universe will collapse completely into a singularity, a point of zero size and infinite density without space and time,

109
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,700
the way it might have been before the Big Bang.

110
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,540
Or the universe could bounce back, restarting the cosmic expansion, creating a new baby universe.

111
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,580
Somewhat poetic really, everything died, but everything is reborn.

112
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,220
But to be clear, we have zero evidence that this has happened before or well in the future.

113
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,780
So, what will happen?

114
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,500
Most scientists think that dark energy will stay constant,

115
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,260
so the likely fate of the universe is heat death, eternal cold and utter boredom.

116
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,460
Which seems sad, but has a huge upside. In this scenario, we get to have the universe for the longest.

117
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,660
It gives us trillions of years to expand, jump from star to star, maybe even from galaxy to galaxy.

118
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,660
We might even find a way to keep consciousness around forever. We don't know.

119
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,780
So we just have to wait and see, and make the most of the amazing universe we have right now.

120
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,780
Hey you, why don't you stick around for a bit longer? We want to tell you about something that changed Kurzgesagt forever.

121
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:23,260
Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale passion project, but creating animated science videos that are free for everyone doesn't pay the bills.

122
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:31,140
Damn you, reality. In order to make ends meet, we had to take on real jobs during the day and create Kurzgesagt videos at night.

123
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:39,140
It was tough, but our dream of inspiring people all around the world kept us going. Then, in 2016, everything changed.

124
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:46,980
Kurzgesagt's founder, Philip Detmer, had an idea. He wanted to create something inspiring that would extend beyond the digital YouTube cosmos.

125
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:55,340
Something tangible. Something that would represent Kurzgesagt's view of the world, and our belief in humanity's potential for greatness.

126
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,940
His idea? The Kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar. It establishes a New Year's Zero to include all people and cultures around the world.

127
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:15,380
This New Year's Zero roughly 12,000 years ago signifies a time when humans first started working together on a larger scale, laying the foundation for modern society, and eventually, our future ahead of us.

128
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:22,340
The first Human Era Calendar was a huge success. It sold out within a few hours, and inspired thousands of burbs around the globe.

129
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:29,300
Every year since then, we've created a new edition of the Human Era Calendar, each one more spectacular and successful than the last.

130
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,620
It has enabled us to grow our team, improve our video quality and research standards, and still release our videos for free for everyone.

131
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:45,260
This year's calendar is extra special. Join us as we conduct a series of space experiments to see how they would affect the development of life.

132
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:53,060
What would a creature living near an orange dwarf look like? Could life still exist after a supernova explosion? And what the hell is this?

133
00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:01,580
Join us in 12,024 and find out. And of course, you can also use it to plan humanity's next steps towards greatness.

134
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,980
To celebrate what may be our most glorious calendar yet, we've prepared a few spectacular limited deals for you.

135
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Thank you so much for being a part of our story and for coming together every year to make all of this possible. See you in 12,024.
