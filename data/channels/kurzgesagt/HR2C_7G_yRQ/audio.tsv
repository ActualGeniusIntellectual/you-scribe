3580	9620	Every sale of our limited edition calendar supports what we do here at Kurzgesagt, and our brand-new
10580	18420	12,024 calendar is our most spectacular yet. Don't miss out on your chance to earn a special piece of Kurzgesagt history.
19660	23780	The universe is going to die one day, but how?
24180	30300	Well, it turns out our cosmic fate will be decided by a fight between two titans.
31140	34220	The two warriors deciding the fate of the universe.
34620	39920	Our universe was born 14 billion years ago in the Big Bang and has been expanding ever since.
40180	45100	For some reason, new empty space is being created out of nothing between galaxies.
45560	51520	Space itself is becoming bigger. Will it go on forever, or will it stop one day?
52520	57520	Today, we think the universe is at the mercy of two cosmic demigods fighting for dominance.
57780	60640	The first one is all the stuff in the universe.
61120	67060	Galaxies, gas, dark matter. While they're very different, they just want to do one thing, get together.
67760	71440	Matter is attracted by matter, pulled together by gravity, and
72060	76920	gravity also pulls on the universe as a whole, slowing the expansion that started at the Big Bang.
77480	80280	Our second warrior is empty space.
81080	87160	While it seems, well, empty and powerless, empty space has an intrinsic energy.
87560	91280	We don't really have an idea what this energy is or why it's there.
91600	98880	It's really a placeholder that fills a blank in our understanding of reality, but it's got a cool name, dark energy.
99480	105560	Dark energy pushes things apart, a sort of anti-gravity that accelerates the cosmic expansion.
105960	113000	So, we have all the matter in the universe pulling in, and empty space infused with dark energy pushing out.
114000	117180	Whoever wins will kill the universe in fun ways.
117840	122080	But who will win? It all depends on the mysterious dark energy.
122320	127420	Will its strength stay the same, a common assumption just because it keeps our models simple?
127880	132260	Or will it get weaker, or will it get more powerful over time?
132260	134260	One.
134940	137340	Constant dark energy, heat death.
138020	141660	If the strength of dark energy stays constant, it will win the war.
142060	148340	Since space is growing, matter is getting more and more diluted, like sugar in a cup being filled with more and more tea.
148820	154380	But as the universe expands, new empty space is created, which brings more dark energy,
154380	160740	which pushes everything apart even more, which creates more empty space, which makes the universe grow even faster.
161300	165360	A feedback loop that will make the universe expand at an exponential rate.
166180	170460	Every 12 billion years or so, it will double in diameter, forever.
171140	176100	But while dark energy is winning the war, matter is winning at least one battle.
176460	178860	At short distances, it can keep things together.
179740	183220	Local galaxy bubbles can overcome the push of dark energy.
183420	189800	In a few billion years, our local group of galaxies will merge into a gigantic ball with trillions of stars.
190280	193000	It will soon become our last view of the cosmos.
193560	196480	All other galaxies will be pushed away by the expansion.
196840	202260	For us, it will look like the rest of the universe is rushing away, until in a few hundred billion years,
202260	204260	we won't see other galaxies at all.
204760	208600	We'll be alone, surrounded by a seemingly infinite dark void.
209120	214080	In about 100 trillion years, all the stars of our super galaxy will have died out.
214520	219520	All gas that could create new stars has been consumed, and no new gas can come in.
220360	223320	The galaxy will be dark and filled with stellar corpses.
223880	230520	Over quadrillions of years, white dwarfs and neutron stars will slowly cool, until becoming truly dark,
230960	233280	turning off the last lights of the universe.
233920	237040	All structures, big and small, will slowly dissolve.
237520	245240	One by one, all dead stars and planets will leave the super galaxy, which slowly dissolves over six-dillions of years.
245640	250240	Every object will end up on its own, which means that dark energy takes over again,
250780	253360	creating more and more empty space between everything.
253960	258760	Objects will be so far apart, that it will be as if each had a universe for itself.
259560	264860	Not much happens anymore, until in a good old years, all black holes will have evaporated.
265360	269980	In the end, entropy and dark energy won't stop until their job is finished.
270540	273360	Over time spans you might as well call, forever,
273360	280460	all remaining structures might even dissolve into single particles that will be pushed away from each other by an ever-growing empty space.
281300	286280	Imagine a whole universe, with just a single lonely particle, traveling through nothingness.
286940	292860	This is the final state, the true end, the big freeze, or heat death.
293380	297700	A completely featureless, cold, and eternally expanding universe.
298500	302060	Nothing will ever be able to happen again, forever.
303580	305580	That was a bummer, what else could happen?
307060	310400	Two, increasing dark energy, big rip.
311120	316980	What if dark energy gets stronger? In this case, empty space won't just win over matter,
317020	323420	it will literally rip it to pieces. In the big freeze scenario, matter lost the war, but won some battles.
323700	326060	But here, matter wins nothing.
326580	329000	Dark energy is growing stronger over time,
329420	334400	overcoming the pull of gravity, and creating new empty space at smaller and smaller distances.
334720	340820	In this scenario, things will escalate quickly. It could start as early as 20 billion years from now.
341620	345620	First, dark energy will create empty space between individual galaxies.
346180	352460	Our galaxy will leave its local cluster and begin to drift alone in a rapidly inflating and ever darker cosmos.
352740	357360	Some billion years later, empty space starts to push between individual stars,
357780	361140	dissolving the galaxy. If you live on a planet in a star system,
361500	367500	the night sky will start looking sad and gloomy, as other stars are pushed too far away to be seen.
368020	374060	A few million years after the sky turns dark, dark energy starts to create empty space inside star systems.
374380	379120	Your planet is pushed away from its star, and all life in the universe freezes to death.
380000	386440	There's not much time left, as a few months later, dark energy is creating empty space inside solid objects.
387120	392880	Stars, neutron stars, planets, asteroids, everything solid, is being ripped into pieces.
393120	397400	If you're on a spaceship, you only have a short time before you are ripped apart.
397840	405820	Half an hour later, even atoms are destroyed, as new space is being created so furiously that electrons and nuclei are separated.
406460	409740	Now the universe has just a fraction of a second left.
410260	415940	In this final moment, only dying black holes remain, drained and defeated by dark energy.
416140	424860	They're tiny, septillions of times smaller than an atom, and they explode with the power of a trillion supernovae in a trillionth of an octillionth of a second.
425560	429060	Finally, the very fabric of reality is torn to its core,
429780	435700	obliterating space-time itself. The big rip. Space and time have lost their meanings.
435980	438580	Making it impossible to predict what will happen next.
439700	441620	Ugh.
441620	442980	Three.
442980	445200	Decreasing dark energy. Big crunch.
446420	447660	Poor matter.
447660	453140	But there is one scenario where it wins. If the strength of dark energy decreases with time,
453140	460140	and if this reduction is strong enough, the pull of gravity will win, and all the things in existence will move towards each other.
460940	463780	Unfortunately, making the universe collapse into itself.
464500	469060	No one knows when this might begin, but it could be as soon as a few hundred million years.
469740	471500	What will it look like?
471500	479300	As the universe begins to contract, over billions of years, galaxies and galaxy clusters approach each other until they eventually collide.
479940	484620	They're mostly made of empty space, so a collision is like the gentle merger of two clouds.
485180	490420	At any rate, first galaxies and later individual stars get closer and closer.
490740	495940	As the universe goes on collapsing, you might worry about stars and planets eventually crashing against each other.
496220	498820	This will happen, but it's not your worst problem.
498820	504540	If space itself shrinks, this also concentrates all the radiation emitted in the past by all the stars,
505060	508140	supernovae and quasars that ever existed. Now,
508500	515680	empty space is filled with radiation. The dark nothing between stars is heating up, making life unpleasant and then
515980	517980	impossible, as planets just burn.
518500	523260	Slowly at first, then rapidly, space gets as hot as it was after the Big Bang.
523940	530780	Stars are pretty hot, but now the space around them is hotter. They're literally boiled from the outside.
531540	537900	As the universe collapses into itself, all galaxies and all stars merge into a single ball of hot plasma.
538620	540620	The Big Crunch is complete.
541500	543500	From here on, there are two possibilities.
544140	551180	Either the universe will collapse completely into a singularity, a point of zero size and infinite density without space and time,
551600	553700	the way it might have been before the Big Bang.
554220	560540	Or the universe could bounce back, restarting the cosmic expansion, creating a new baby universe.
561780	565580	Somewhat poetic really, everything died, but everything is reborn.
566220	571220	But to be clear, we have zero evidence that this has happened before or well in the future.
571780	573780	So, what will happen?
574140	577500	Most scientists think that dark energy will stay constant,
577500	582260	so the likely fate of the universe is heat death, eternal cold and utter boredom.
582740	589460	Which seems sad, but has a huge upside. In this scenario, we get to have the universe for the longest.
589700	595660	It gives us trillions of years to expand, jump from star to star, maybe even from galaxy to galaxy.
596300	600660	We might even find a way to keep consciousness around forever. We don't know.
601260	606780	So we just have to wait and see, and make the most of the amazing universe we have right now.
608740	614780	Hey you, why don't you stick around for a bit longer? We want to tell you about something that changed Kurzgesagt forever.
615500	623260	Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale passion project, but creating animated science videos that are free for everyone doesn't pay the bills.
623700	631140	Damn you, reality. In order to make ends meet, we had to take on real jobs during the day and create Kurzgesagt videos at night.
631260	639140	It was tough, but our dream of inspiring people all around the world kept us going. Then, in 2016, everything changed.
639700	646980	Kurzgesagt's founder, Philip Detmer, had an idea. He wanted to create something inspiring that would extend beyond the digital YouTube cosmos.
647380	655340	Something tangible. Something that would represent Kurzgesagt's view of the world, and our belief in humanity's potential for greatness.
656300	663940	His idea? The Kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar. It establishes a New Year's Zero to include all people and cultures around the world.
664380	675380	This New Year's Zero roughly 12,000 years ago signifies a time when humans first started working together on a larger scale, laying the foundation for modern society, and eventually, our future ahead of us.
675900	682340	The first Human Era Calendar was a huge success. It sold out within a few hours, and inspired thousands of burbs around the globe.
682820	689300	Every year since then, we've created a new edition of the Human Era Calendar, each one more spectacular and successful than the last.
689860	696620	It has enabled us to grow our team, improve our video quality and research standards, and still release our videos for free for everyone.
697220	705260	This year's calendar is extra special. Join us as we conduct a series of space experiments to see how they would affect the development of life.
705620	713060	What would a creature living near an orange dwarf look like? Could life still exist after a supernova explosion? And what the hell is this?
713580	721580	Join us in 12,024 and find out. And of course, you can also use it to plan humanity's next steps towards greatness.
721980	727980	To celebrate what may be our most glorious calendar yet, we've prepared a few spectacular limited deals for you.
727980	736980	Thank you so much for being a part of our story and for coming together every year to make all of this possible. See you in 12,024.
