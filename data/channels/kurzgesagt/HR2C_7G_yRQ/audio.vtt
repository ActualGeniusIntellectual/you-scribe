00:03.580 --> 00:09.620
Every sale of our limited edition calendar supports what we do here at Kurzgesagt, and our brand-new

00:10.580 --> 00:18.420
12,024 calendar is our most spectacular yet. Don't miss out on your chance to earn a special piece of Kurzgesagt history.

00:19.660 --> 00:23.780
The universe is going to die one day, but how?

00:24.180 --> 00:30.300
Well, it turns out our cosmic fate will be decided by a fight between two titans.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.220
The two warriors deciding the fate of the universe.

00:34.620 --> 00:39.920
Our universe was born 14 billion years ago in the Big Bang and has been expanding ever since.

00:40.180 --> 00:45.100
For some reason, new empty space is being created out of nothing between galaxies.

00:45.560 --> 00:51.520
Space itself is becoming bigger. Will it go on forever, or will it stop one day?

00:52.520 --> 00:57.520
Today, we think the universe is at the mercy of two cosmic demigods fighting for dominance.

00:57.780 --> 01:00.640
The first one is all the stuff in the universe.

01:01.120 --> 01:07.060
Galaxies, gas, dark matter. While they're very different, they just want to do one thing, get together.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.440
Matter is attracted by matter, pulled together by gravity, and

01:12.060 --> 01:16.920
gravity also pulls on the universe as a whole, slowing the expansion that started at the Big Bang.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.280
Our second warrior is empty space.

01:21.080 --> 01:27.160
While it seems, well, empty and powerless, empty space has an intrinsic energy.

01:27.560 --> 01:31.280
We don't really have an idea what this energy is or why it's there.

01:31.600 --> 01:38.880
It's really a placeholder that fills a blank in our understanding of reality, but it's got a cool name, dark energy.

01:39.480 --> 01:45.560
Dark energy pushes things apart, a sort of anti-gravity that accelerates the cosmic expansion.

01:45.960 --> 01:53.000
So, we have all the matter in the universe pulling in, and empty space infused with dark energy pushing out.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.180
Whoever wins will kill the universe in fun ways.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.080
But who will win? It all depends on the mysterious dark energy.

02:02.320 --> 02:07.420
Will its strength stay the same, a common assumption just because it keeps our models simple?

02:07.880 --> 02:12.260
Or will it get weaker, or will it get more powerful over time?

02:12.260 --> 02:14.260
One.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.340
Constant dark energy, heat death.

02:18.020 --> 02:21.660
If the strength of dark energy stays constant, it will win the war.

02:22.060 --> 02:28.340
Since space is growing, matter is getting more and more diluted, like sugar in a cup being filled with more and more tea.

02:28.820 --> 02:34.380
But as the universe expands, new empty space is created, which brings more dark energy,

02:34.380 --> 02:40.740
which pushes everything apart even more, which creates more empty space, which makes the universe grow even faster.

02:41.300 --> 02:45.360
A feedback loop that will make the universe expand at an exponential rate.

02:46.180 --> 02:50.460
Every 12 billion years or so, it will double in diameter, forever.

02:51.140 --> 02:56.100
But while dark energy is winning the war, matter is winning at least one battle.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.860
At short distances, it can keep things together.

02:59.740 --> 03:03.220
Local galaxy bubbles can overcome the push of dark energy.

03:03.420 --> 03:09.800
In a few billion years, our local group of galaxies will merge into a gigantic ball with trillions of stars.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.000
It will soon become our last view of the cosmos.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.480
All other galaxies will be pushed away by the expansion.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.260
For us, it will look like the rest of the universe is rushing away, until in a few hundred billion years,

03:22.260 --> 03:24.260
we won't see other galaxies at all.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.600
We'll be alone, surrounded by a seemingly infinite dark void.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.080
In about 100 trillion years, all the stars of our super galaxy will have died out.

03:34.520 --> 03:39.520
All gas that could create new stars has been consumed, and no new gas can come in.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.320
The galaxy will be dark and filled with stellar corpses.

03:43.880 --> 03:50.520
Over quadrillions of years, white dwarfs and neutron stars will slowly cool, until becoming truly dark,

03:50.960 --> 03:53.280
turning off the last lights of the universe.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.040
All structures, big and small, will slowly dissolve.

03:57.520 --> 04:05.240
One by one, all dead stars and planets will leave the super galaxy, which slowly dissolves over six-dillions of years.

04:05.640 --> 04:10.240
Every object will end up on its own, which means that dark energy takes over again,

04:10.780 --> 04:13.360
creating more and more empty space between everything.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.760
Objects will be so far apart, that it will be as if each had a universe for itself.

04:19.560 --> 04:24.860
Not much happens anymore, until in a good old years, all black holes will have evaporated.

04:25.360 --> 04:29.980
In the end, entropy and dark energy won't stop until their job is finished.

04:30.540 --> 04:33.360
Over time spans you might as well call, forever,

04:33.360 --> 04:40.460
all remaining structures might even dissolve into single particles that will be pushed away from each other by an ever-growing empty space.

04:41.300 --> 04:46.280
Imagine a whole universe, with just a single lonely particle, traveling through nothingness.

04:46.940 --> 04:52.860
This is the final state, the true end, the big freeze, or heat death.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.700
A completely featureless, cold, and eternally expanding universe.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.060
Nothing will ever be able to happen again, forever.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.580
That was a bummer, what else could happen?

05:07.060 --> 05:10.400
Two, increasing dark energy, big rip.

05:11.120 --> 05:16.980
What if dark energy gets stronger? In this case, empty space won't just win over matter,

05:17.020 --> 05:23.420
it will literally rip it to pieces. In the big freeze scenario, matter lost the war, but won some battles.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.060
But here, matter wins nothing.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.000
Dark energy is growing stronger over time,

05:29.420 --> 05:34.400
overcoming the pull of gravity, and creating new empty space at smaller and smaller distances.

05:34.720 --> 05:40.820
In this scenario, things will escalate quickly. It could start as early as 20 billion years from now.

05:41.620 --> 05:45.620
First, dark energy will create empty space between individual galaxies.

05:46.180 --> 05:52.460
Our galaxy will leave its local cluster and begin to drift alone in a rapidly inflating and ever darker cosmos.

05:52.740 --> 05:57.360
Some billion years later, empty space starts to push between individual stars,

05:57.780 --> 06:01.140
dissolving the galaxy. If you live on a planet in a star system,

06:01.500 --> 06:07.500
the night sky will start looking sad and gloomy, as other stars are pushed too far away to be seen.

06:08.020 --> 06:14.060
A few million years after the sky turns dark, dark energy starts to create empty space inside star systems.

06:14.380 --> 06:19.120
Your planet is pushed away from its star, and all life in the universe freezes to death.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.440
There's not much time left, as a few months later, dark energy is creating empty space inside solid objects.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.880
Stars, neutron stars, planets, asteroids, everything solid, is being ripped into pieces.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.400
If you're on a spaceship, you only have a short time before you are ripped apart.

06:37.840 --> 06:45.820
Half an hour later, even atoms are destroyed, as new space is being created so furiously that electrons and nuclei are separated.

06:46.460 --> 06:49.740
Now the universe has just a fraction of a second left.

06:50.260 --> 06:55.940
In this final moment, only dying black holes remain, drained and defeated by dark energy.

06:56.140 --> 07:04.860
They're tiny, septillions of times smaller than an atom, and they explode with the power of a trillion supernovae in a trillionth of an octillionth of a second.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.060
Finally, the very fabric of reality is torn to its core,

07:09.780 --> 07:15.700
obliterating space-time itself. The big rip. Space and time have lost their meanings.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.580
Making it impossible to predict what will happen next.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.620
Ugh.

07:21.620 --> 07:22.980
Three.

07:22.980 --> 07:25.200
Decreasing dark energy. Big crunch.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.660
Poor matter.

07:27.660 --> 07:33.140
But there is one scenario where it wins. If the strength of dark energy decreases with time,

07:33.140 --> 07:40.140
and if this reduction is strong enough, the pull of gravity will win, and all the things in existence will move towards each other.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.780
Unfortunately, making the universe collapse into itself.

07:44.500 --> 07:49.060
No one knows when this might begin, but it could be as soon as a few hundred million years.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.500
What will it look like?

07:51.500 --> 07:59.300
As the universe begins to contract, over billions of years, galaxies and galaxy clusters approach each other until they eventually collide.

07:59.940 --> 08:04.620
They're mostly made of empty space, so a collision is like the gentle merger of two clouds.

08:05.180 --> 08:10.420
At any rate, first galaxies and later individual stars get closer and closer.

08:10.740 --> 08:15.940
As the universe goes on collapsing, you might worry about stars and planets eventually crashing against each other.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.820
This will happen, but it's not your worst problem.

08:18.820 --> 08:24.540
If space itself shrinks, this also concentrates all the radiation emitted in the past by all the stars,

08:25.060 --> 08:28.140
supernovae and quasars that ever existed. Now,

08:28.500 --> 08:35.680
empty space is filled with radiation. The dark nothing between stars is heating up, making life unpleasant and then

08:35.980 --> 08:37.980
impossible, as planets just burn.

08:38.500 --> 08:43.260
Slowly at first, then rapidly, space gets as hot as it was after the Big Bang.

08:43.940 --> 08:50.780
Stars are pretty hot, but now the space around them is hotter. They're literally boiled from the outside.

08:51.540 --> 08:57.900
As the universe collapses into itself, all galaxies and all stars merge into a single ball of hot plasma.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.620
The Big Crunch is complete.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
From here on, there are two possibilities.

09:04.140 --> 09:11.180
Either the universe will collapse completely into a singularity, a point of zero size and infinite density without space and time,

09:11.600 --> 09:13.700
the way it might have been before the Big Bang.

09:14.220 --> 09:20.540
Or the universe could bounce back, restarting the cosmic expansion, creating a new baby universe.

09:21.780 --> 09:25.580
Somewhat poetic really, everything died, but everything is reborn.

09:26.220 --> 09:31.220
But to be clear, we have zero evidence that this has happened before or well in the future.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.780
So, what will happen?

09:34.140 --> 09:37.500
Most scientists think that dark energy will stay constant,

09:37.500 --> 09:42.260
so the likely fate of the universe is heat death, eternal cold and utter boredom.

09:42.740 --> 09:49.460
Which seems sad, but has a huge upside. In this scenario, we get to have the universe for the longest.

09:49.700 --> 09:55.660
It gives us trillions of years to expand, jump from star to star, maybe even from galaxy to galaxy.

09:56.300 --> 10:00.660
We might even find a way to keep consciousness around forever. We don't know.

10:01.260 --> 10:06.780
So we just have to wait and see, and make the most of the amazing universe we have right now.

10:08.740 --> 10:14.780
Hey you, why don't you stick around for a bit longer? We want to tell you about something that changed Kurzgesagt forever.

10:15.500 --> 10:23.260
Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale passion project, but creating animated science videos that are free for everyone doesn't pay the bills.

10:23.700 --> 10:31.140
Damn you, reality. In order to make ends meet, we had to take on real jobs during the day and create Kurzgesagt videos at night.

10:31.260 --> 10:39.140
It was tough, but our dream of inspiring people all around the world kept us going. Then, in 2016, everything changed.

10:39.700 --> 10:46.980
Kurzgesagt's founder, Philip Detmer, had an idea. He wanted to create something inspiring that would extend beyond the digital YouTube cosmos.

10:47.380 --> 10:55.340
Something tangible. Something that would represent Kurzgesagt's view of the world, and our belief in humanity's potential for greatness.

10:56.300 --> 11:03.940
His idea? The Kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar. It establishes a New Year's Zero to include all people and cultures around the world.

11:04.380 --> 11:15.380
This New Year's Zero roughly 12,000 years ago signifies a time when humans first started working together on a larger scale, laying the foundation for modern society, and eventually, our future ahead of us.

11:15.900 --> 11:22.340
The first Human Era Calendar was a huge success. It sold out within a few hours, and inspired thousands of burbs around the globe.

11:22.820 --> 11:29.300
Every year since then, we've created a new edition of the Human Era Calendar, each one more spectacular and successful than the last.

11:29.860 --> 11:36.620
It has enabled us to grow our team, improve our video quality and research standards, and still release our videos for free for everyone.

11:37.220 --> 11:45.260
This year's calendar is extra special. Join us as we conduct a series of space experiments to see how they would affect the development of life.

11:45.620 --> 11:53.060
What would a creature living near an orange dwarf look like? Could life still exist after a supernova explosion? And what the hell is this?

11:53.580 --> 12:01.580
Join us in 12,024 and find out. And of course, you can also use it to plan humanity's next steps towards greatness.

12:01.980 --> 12:07.980
To celebrate what may be our most glorious calendar yet, we've prepared a few spectacular limited deals for you.

12:07.980 --> 12:16.980
Thank you so much for being a part of our story and for coming together every year to make all of this possible. See you in 12,024.
