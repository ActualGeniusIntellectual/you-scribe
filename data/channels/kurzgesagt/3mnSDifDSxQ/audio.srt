1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
What is the largest star in the universe? And why is it that large? And what are stars anyway?

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,760
Things that would like to be stars. We begin our journey with Earth, not to learn anything,

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,800
just to get a vague sense of scale. The smallest things that have some star-like properties are

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,480
large gas giants or sub-brown dwarfs. Like Jupiter, the most massive planet in the solar system.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,600
11 times larger and 317 times more massive than Earth and more or less made of the same stuff as

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,960
our Sun. Just much much less of it. The transition towards stars begins with brown dwarfs, failed

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,640
stars that are a huge disappointment to their mums. They have between 13 and 90 times the mass

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,560
of Jupiter. So even if we took 90 Jupiters and threw them at each other, although fun to watch,

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,560
it wouldn't be enough to create a star. Interestingly, adding lots of mass to a brown

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,240
dwarf doesn't make it much bigger, just its insides denser. This increases the pressure in

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,720
the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion reactions happen slowly and the object glow a

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,600
little. So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giant that don't fit into any category very well.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,040
But we want to talk about stars, not failed wannabe stars, so let's move on.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:34,120
Main sequence stars. Once large gas balls pass a certain mass threshold, their cores become hot and

15
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,240
dense enough to ignite. Hydrogen is fused to helium in their cores, releasing tremendous

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,560
amounts of energy. Stars that do that are called main sequence stars. The more massive a main

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,360
sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns and the shorter its life is. Once the

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,880
hydrogen burning phase is over, stars grow up to hundreds of thousands of times their original

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,760
size. But these giant phases only last for a fraction of their lifespan. So we'll be

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,120
comparing stars at drastically different stages in their lives. This doesn't make them less

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,400
impressive, but maybe it's good to keep in mind that we'll be comparing babies to adults.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,920
Now back to the beginning. The smallest real stars are red dwarfs, about 100 times the mass

23
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,920
of Jupiter, barely massive enough to fuse hydrogen to helium. Because they are not very massive,

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,160
they are small, not very hot, and shine pretty dimly. They are the only stars in the main

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,360
sequence that don't grow once they die, but sort of fizzle out. Red dwarfs are by far the most

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,800
abundant type in the universe. Because they burn their fuel very slowly, it lasts them up to 10

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,080
trillion years, a thousand times the current age of the universe. For example, one of the

28
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,880
closest stars to Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard star, but it shines too dimly to be seen

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,920
without a telescope. We made a whole video on red dwarfs if you want to learn more. The next stage

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,440
are stars like our Sun. To say the Sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice, since

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,960
it makes up 99.86% of all its mass. It burns far hotter and brighter than red dwarfs, which reduces

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,840
its lifetime to about 10 billion years. The Sun is seven times more massive than Barnard star,

33
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,000
but that makes it nearly 300 times brighter with twice its surface temperature. Let's go bigger.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,560
Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's brightness. The brightest

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,000
star in the night sky, Sirius, is two solar masses with a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun,

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,800
but its surface is nearly 10,000 degrees Celsius, making it shine 25 times brighter. Burning that

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:07,280
hot reduces its total lifespan by four times to 2.5 billion years. Stars close to 10 times the

38
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,080
mass of our Sun have surface temperatures near 25,000 degrees Celsius. Beta Centauri contains

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,080
two of these massive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times the power of the Sun. That's

40
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,560
a lot of power coming from something only 13 times larger, but they'll only burn for about

41
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,240
20 million years. Entire generations of these blue stars die in the time it takes the Sun to

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,360
orbit the galaxy once. So is this the formula? The more massive, the larger the star. The most

43
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:48,840
massive star that we know is R136a1. It has 315 solar masses and is nearly 9 million times

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,840
brighter than the Sun. And yet, despite its tremendous mass and power, it's barely 30

45
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,160
times the size of the Sun. The star is so extreme and barely held together by gravity that it loses

46
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,360
321,000 billion tons of material through its stellar wind every single second. Stars of this

47
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,040
sort are extremely rare because they break the rules of star formation a tiny bit. When

48
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,120
supermassive stars are born, they burn extremely hot and bright. And this blows away any extra gas

49
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,680
that could make them more massive. So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the Sun.

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,560
The stars like R136a1 are probably formed through the merger of several high mass stars in dense

51
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,080
star forming regions and burn their core hydrogen in only a few million years. So this means they

52
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,160
are rare and short-lived. From here, the trick to going bigger isn't adding more mass. To make

53
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:57,600
the biggest stars, we have to kill them. Red giants. When main sequence stars begin to exhaust

54
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,800
the hydrogen in their core, it contracts, making it hotter and denser. This leads to hotter and

55
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,920
faster fusion, which pushes back against gravity and makes the outer layers swell in a giant phase.

56
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:19,440
And these stars become truly giant indeed. For example, Gakrax. Only 30% more massive than the Sun,

57
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,080
it has swollen to about 84 times its radius. Still, when the Sun enters the last stage of

58
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,640
its life, it will swell and become even bigger. 200 times its current radius. In this final phase

59
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,360
of its life, it will swallow the inner planets. And if you think that's impressive, let's finally

60
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,280
introduce the largest stars in the universe, hypergiants. Hypergiants are the giant phase

61
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,840
of the most massive stars in the universe. They have an enormous surface area that can radiate

62
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:00,080
an insane amount of light. Being so large, they're basically blowing themselves apart as gravity at

63
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,680
the surface is too weak to hold on to the hot mass, which is lifted away in powerful stellar

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,720
winds. Pistol Star is 25 solar masses, but 300 times the radius of the Sun, a blue hypergiant

65
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,840
aptly named for its energetic blue starlight. It's hard to say exactly how long Pistol Star

66
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,920
will live, but probably just a few million years. Even larger than the blue hypergiants are the

67
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,000
yellow hypergiants. The most well-studied is Rho Cassiopeia, a star so bright it can be seen

68
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,800
with the naked eye, although it's thousands of light-years from Earth. At 40 solar masses,

69
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,880
this star is around 500 times the radius of the Sun and 500,000 times brighter. If the Earth were

70
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,800
as close to Rho Cassiopeia as it is to the Sun, it'd be inside it and you would be very dead.

71
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,680
Yellow hypergiants are very rare though, only 15 are known. This means they're likely just a

72
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,960
short-lived intermediate state as a star grows or shrinks between other phases of hypergiantness.

73
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:13,320
With red hypergiants, we reach the largest stars known to us, probably the largest stars even

74
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:22,320
possible. So who's the winner of this insane contest? Well, the truth is we don't know. Red

75
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,280
hypergiants are extremely bright and far away, which means that even tiny uncertainties in our

76
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,760
measurements can give us a huge margin of error for their size. Worse still, red hypergiants are

77
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,720
solar system-sized behemoths that are blowing themselves apart, which makes them harder to

78
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,720
measure. As we do more science and our instruments improve, whatever the largest star is will change.

79
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,560
The star that is currently thought to be among the largest we found is Stevenson 218. It was

80
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,080
probably born as a main sequence star a few tens of times the mass of the Sun and has likely lost

81
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:06,320
about half its mass by now. While typical red hypergiants are 1,500 times the size of the Sun,

82
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:15,280
the largest rough estimate places Stevenson 218 at 2,150 solar radii and shining with almost half

83
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:23,240
a million times the power of the Sun. By comparison, the Sun seems like a grain of dust. Our brains

84
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,040
don't really have a way of grasping this kind of scale. Even at light speed, it would take you

85
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,120
8.7 hours to travel around at once. The fastest plane on Earth would take around 500 years. Dropped

86
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,400
on the Sun, it would fill Saturn's orbit. As it evolves, it will probably shed even more mass and

87
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,720
shrink down into another hotter hypergiant phase, accumulate heavy elements in its core before

88
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,520
finally exploding in a core collapse supernova, giving its gas back to the galaxy. This gas will

89
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,360
then go on to form another generation of stars of all sizes, starting the cycle of birth and death

90
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,440
again to light up our universe. Let's make this journey again, but this time without the talking.

91
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,960
The universe is big. There are many large things in it.

92
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:42,160
If you want to play a bit more with science stuff, we have good news. We've created our

93
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,620
first app, Universe in a Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the brain behind Wait But Why. You can

94
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,360
seamlessly travel from the smallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells,

95
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,720
and dinosaurs, all the way to the largest stars and galaxies, and marvel at the whole observable

96
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,600
universe. You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. The

97
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,320
app is inspired by the Scale of the Universe website by the Huang twins that we spent a lot

98
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,720
of time with when it came out years ago, and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait

99
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,200
But Why and Kurzgesagt version. You can get it in your app store, there are no in-app purchases and

100
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,400
no ads. All future updates are included. And since this is our first app, we'd love to hear

101
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,800
your feedback so we can improve it over time. If this sounds good to you, download the Universe

102
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,960
in a Nutshell app now and leave us a 5-star review if you want to support it. Kurzgesagt

103
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,320
and all the projects we do are mostly funded by viewers like you. So if you like the app,

104
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,120
we'll make more digital things in future. Thank you for watching.
