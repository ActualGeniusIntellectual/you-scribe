0	4000	Every two years, one million Japanese disappear.
4000	8000	China's population will halve by the end of the century.
8000	11000	The median age in Italy has reached 48.
11000	14000	All around the world, birth rates are crashing.
14000	16000	Is humanity dying out?
16000	19000	What's going on? And how bad is it?
19000	35000	For hundreds of thousands of years, the human population barely grew at all, haunted by disease, famine, and war, until the Industrial Revolution.
35000	44000	Exponential progress led to exponential growth, pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the year 1999, and 8 billion just 24 years later.
44000	50000	And our numbers will continue to rise for at least another 60 years, but this growth obscures something.
50000	53000	People kind of stopped having babies.
53000	57000	For a stable population, every couple needs to have two children on average.
57000	61000	If the number is higher, it grows. If lower, it shrinks.
61000	65000	If it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly.
65000	69000	Like in South Korea, one of the hottest exporters of pop culture.
69000	75000	Its fertility rate lay at 0.8 children per woman in 2022, the lowest in the world.
75000	83000	This means 100 South Koreans of childbearing age today will have 40 kids, who then will have 16 kids, who then will have 6.
83000	92000	If nothing changes, then within 100 years, there will be 94% fewer young people, and South Korea will see a population implosion.
92000	94000	That is, if things stay the same.
94000	98000	We have yet to see if there's a bottom to fertility rates.
98000	103000	Although looking at the bigger picture and absolute numbers, this population will not shrink that much.
103000	106000	It simply returns to the level it once was.
106000	109000	In 1950, there were 20 million South Koreans.
109000	115000	In 2023, there are 52 million, and by 2100, there will be 24 million again.
115000	118000	But the issue is not that there will be fewer South Koreans.
118000	121000	The issue is the composition of the population.
121000	124000	In 1950, the median age was 18.
124000	127000	In 2023, it's 45.
127000	130000	In 2100, it will be 59.
130000	132000	A country of seniors.
132000	135000	And South Korea is far from alone.
135000	140000	China may be seeing the steepest population reversal in history, unstoppable at this point.
140000	147000	Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and rising incomes meant that the Chinese started to prefer smaller families.
147000	155000	That, plus the introduction of the one-child policy, which aimed to slow population growth, means that China has had a low fertility rate for decades.
155000	163000	With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman, within four generations, 100 young Chinese will turn into 20.
163000	169000	China's fertility rates are now one of the lowest in East Asia, lower than even Japan's.
169000	178000	In comparison, Europe's depopulation is much slower, despite low fertility, since unlike Asia, most states have had a steady flow of immigrants.
178000	183000	The impact is complex, as a good chunk of immigrants come from other low fertility rate areas.
183000	188000	The number of immigrant women who do have a lot of children is not yet high enough to make a big dent,
188000	194000	and fertility rates of immigrants tend to adjust to the native population within two to three generations.
194000	199000	In Eastern Europe, the decline has sped up even more because many young people have emigrated to stronger economies,
199000	204000	like Germany, whose median age is one of the highest in the world at 46.
204000	207000	Latin America fell below replacement in 2015.
207000	212000	In the US, immigration is the only thing keeping the population growing substantially.
212000	216000	There are still places where fertility rates have not fallen below replacement yet.
216000	221000	In much of the Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, fertility is still high,
221000	229000	which creates the same concerns about overpopulation as when Asia grew very quickly in the 1950s, but that turned out to be unfounded.
229000	234000	But recently, the UN has reduced its forecast for Africa's population drastically.
234000	241000	For Nigeria, estimates were lowered from 733 million to 546 million by 2100.
241000	244000	Similar trends are being noted across the continent.
244000	249000	As Africa develops, fertility rates are shrinking much faster than anticipated.
249000	253000	It's becoming more likely that East Asia's story will repeat itself.
253000	257000	By the end of the century, most places in Africa may be below replacement too.
257000	263000	So declining birth rates and aging populations have become a general trend all over the world.
263000	265000	Why is all of this a big deal?
265000	268000	Demographics and poverty.
268000	272000	For a functioning society, you need enough people in the prime of their lives.
272000	275000	Young and middle-aged people do most of the work.
275000	279000	In any economic system, working-age people create a society's wealth.
279000	282000	In retirement, you stop contributing as much to the economy.
282000	286000	But the majority of healthcare costs are generated by seniors.
286000	291000	The way the world worked in the past was that a lot of younger people took care of a few older people.
291000	295000	Imagine a society where most people are older than 60.
295000	301000	The financial burden for the young will be immense, unsustainable, even for the richest countries.
301000	304000	Even in the best case, this will mean people having to work way longer,
304000	311000	exploding healthcare costs and poverty, while states with shrinking incomes struggle to keep up with rising costs.
311000	315000	Technology might soften the blow, but can't compensate entirely.
315000	317000	We can see this happening already.
317000	322000	11 out of 31 provinces in China are running deficits for their pension funds.
322000	327000	They got old before they got rich, and now they can't really catch up anymore.
327000	333000	China's working-age population is predicted to fall by 20%, or 200 million people by 2050,
333000	337000	as much as today's entire working-age population of the US.
337000	342000	Infrastructure collapse is an almost universal constant of population decline,
342000	348000	because infrastructure works at scale and doesn't get cheaper to operate if it's used by fewer people.
348000	353000	If a population declines, be it because of urbanization or the loss of industry and employment,
353000	359000	once people and their income disappear, the resources necessary to sustain infrastructure disappear too.
359000	367000	You can see it in many depopulated towns and cities in East Germany that suffered sharp population decline after German reunification.
367000	372000	Or look at Japan. You can tour the countryside to see dying towns.
372000	378000	Wait. If there are a few people, won't life get cheaper and better, and there'll be more resources to go around?
378000	382000	Well, no. Population decline doesn't lead to prosperity.
382000	387000	It's people's ideas and work that create our prosperity, not the mere availability of resources.
387000	395000	Another danger for aging societies is that elected governments could decide to mostly represent the interests and fears of their elderly populations,
395000	400000	potentially leading to short-term thinking and a preference for conserving wealth over innovation.
400000	406000	That's not a society that can handle issues like climate change, which need massive investment and fresh ideas,
406000	409000	something the world is already having a hard time with.
409000	415000	Many people think that having fewer humans on Earth is actually a good thing because our societies are too unsustainable,
415000	419000	we're using up too many resources, and because of climate change.
419000	427000	The problem is that even if you want fewer humans, this process is very likely too slow to have a positive impact on the environment.
427000	433000	The world population is going to grow for at least 60 more years before it may shrink again.
433000	435000	By then, we have to solve climate change.
435000	443000	Likewise, any other upsides a lower population might have will most likely not materialize themselves this century.
443000	448000	So, just like import people, the easiest solution seems to be immigration,
448000	453000	but the fertility of immigrants adjusts to local levels within three generations.
453000	460000	So you need a constant influx of new migrants, which is not sustainable long-term, as birth rates are dropping everywhere.
460000	466000	The only way would be to keep poor countries poor so that the young and motivated migrate to developed countries
466000	471000	looking for opportunity and a better life, kind of an immoral thing to wish for.
471000	475000	By the end of the century, Africa will have the highest number of young people in the world,
475000	479000	and so African migrants might become the world's most sought-after immigrants,
479000	483000	elderly nations fighting hard for every person willing to make the move.
483000	489000	Immigration can also create societal or cultural tensions, which is a universal phenomenon in all cultures,
489000	496000	especially when cultures with very different sets of values meet, often leading to a backlash that slows immigration down again.
496000	504000	It's easy to be frustrated at this, but ignoring this will only divide societies, empower demagogues, and increase xenophobia.
504000	511000	Economically, immigration is largely beneficial for societies, even if this seems counterintuitive to many people.
511000	519000	Especially countries like the US, an immigrant nation built on the idea of personal freedom and opportunity through hard work, will benefit the most.
519000	526000	Countries like this will have a clear advantage this century, especially if they can attract the world's brightest and most ambitious.
526000	528000	Conclusion and our opinion.
528000	534000	This topic is way too big, affects societies as diverse as literally all of humanity.
534000	538000	So, please take this part with a gigantic grain of salt.
538000	541000	Obviously, we're looking at this from our central European perspective.
541000	547000	One way to look at falling birth rates is as a side effect of the world being less bad than it was.
547000	552000	Especially women are freer, more educated, and wealthier than in the past.
552000	558000	But it turns out that if societies are better off, individuals often decide to have fewer kids.
558000	563000	Interestingly, there's a gap between how many kids people want and how many they're having.
563000	569000	The mean number of kids women in Europe want is around 2.3, much more than they're actually having.
569000	576000	While we gained a lot of freedoms in the last century, across continents and economic systems, that came at a cost.
576000	581000	The tight-knit communities and family structures that were part of our nature, where kids could be brought up by a village.
581000	586000	Today, young parents have to deal with different challenges and societal expectations.
586000	591000	Women are kind of ground down between the wish and expectation to have a family and a career.
591000	594000	Being pressured to do both, but not compromise either.
594000	600000	Men are sharing parental duties more equally than they used to, but are often still expected to be the provider.
600000	605000	And it's sadly true that usually at least one parent's career is held back.
605000	611000	In many developed countries, the gender pay gap is chiefly a pay gap between mothers and everyone else.
611000	617000	But it's not just outside pressure. Our culture of individualism probably plays a role too.
617000	623000	We have only one life to explore, be free, travel, have fun, accomplish something, and try to be happy.
623000	628000	So people commit to partners later in life and often decide against big families or any at all.
628000	631000	And that's fair. Nobody owes their country babies.
632000	639000	So far, no country has successfully managed to increase birth rates significantly, so as of now, we don't really know what works.
639000	643000	But here are a few options to at least make the lives of parents much easier.
643000	649000	Free and abundant access to childcare, financial benefits for parents, more and cheaper housing.
649000	655000	Parenthood has to stop being a career obstacle, and our culture needs to become more positive towards families.
655000	657000	And that's something we can all work on.
657000	660000	The next time you sit next to a crying baby, don't be a jerk about it.
660000	662000	Kids are hard.
662000	666000	In the end, humanity will not die out because we're having fewer babies.
666000	672000	The age and composition of our societies changes quickly, and we need to deal with that sooner rather than later.
672000	679000	But in the end, of all the incredibly hard challenges we've faced before, why would this be the one we can't solve?
