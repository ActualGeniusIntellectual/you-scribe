00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Every two years, one million Japanese disappear.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
China's population will halve by the end of the century.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
The median age in Italy has reached 48.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
All around the world, birth rates are crashing.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Is humanity dying out?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
What's going on? And how bad is it?

00:19.000 --> 00:35.000
For hundreds of thousands of years, the human population barely grew at all, haunted by disease, famine, and war, until the Industrial Revolution.

00:35.000 --> 00:44.000
Exponential progress led to exponential growth, pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the year 1999, and 8 billion just 24 years later.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
And our numbers will continue to rise for at least another 60 years, but this growth obscures something.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
People kind of stopped having babies.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
For a stable population, every couple needs to have two children on average.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
If the number is higher, it grows. If lower, it shrinks.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
If it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Like in South Korea, one of the hottest exporters of pop culture.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
Its fertility rate lay at 0.8 children per woman in 2022, the lowest in the world.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
This means 100 South Koreans of childbearing age today will have 40 kids, who then will have 16 kids, who then will have 6.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
If nothing changes, then within 100 years, there will be 94% fewer young people, and South Korea will see a population implosion.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
That is, if things stay the same.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
We have yet to see if there's a bottom to fertility rates.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Although looking at the bigger picture and absolute numbers, this population will not shrink that much.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It simply returns to the level it once was.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
In 1950, there were 20 million South Koreans.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
In 2023, there are 52 million, and by 2100, there will be 24 million again.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
But the issue is not that there will be fewer South Koreans.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
The issue is the composition of the population.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
In 1950, the median age was 18.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
In 2023, it's 45.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
In 2100, it will be 59.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
A country of seniors.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And South Korea is far from alone.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
China may be seeing the steepest population reversal in history, unstoppable at this point.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and rising incomes meant that the Chinese started to prefer smaller families.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
That, plus the introduction of the one-child policy, which aimed to slow population growth, means that China has had a low fertility rate for decades.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman, within four generations, 100 young Chinese will turn into 20.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
China's fertility rates are now one of the lowest in East Asia, lower than even Japan's.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
In comparison, Europe's depopulation is much slower, despite low fertility, since unlike Asia, most states have had a steady flow of immigrants.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
The impact is complex, as a good chunk of immigrants come from other low fertility rate areas.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
The number of immigrant women who do have a lot of children is not yet high enough to make a big dent,

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
and fertility rates of immigrants tend to adjust to the native population within two to three generations.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
In Eastern Europe, the decline has sped up even more because many young people have emigrated to stronger economies,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
like Germany, whose median age is one of the highest in the world at 46.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Latin America fell below replacement in 2015.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
In the US, immigration is the only thing keeping the population growing substantially.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
There are still places where fertility rates have not fallen below replacement yet.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
In much of the Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, fertility is still high,

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
which creates the same concerns about overpopulation as when Asia grew very quickly in the 1950s, but that turned out to be unfounded.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
But recently, the UN has reduced its forecast for Africa's population drastically.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
For Nigeria, estimates were lowered from 733 million to 546 million by 2100.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Similar trends are being noted across the continent.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
As Africa develops, fertility rates are shrinking much faster than anticipated.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
It's becoming more likely that East Asia's story will repeat itself.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
By the end of the century, most places in Africa may be below replacement too.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
So declining birth rates and aging populations have become a general trend all over the world.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Why is all of this a big deal?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Demographics and poverty.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
For a functioning society, you need enough people in the prime of their lives.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Young and middle-aged people do most of the work.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
In any economic system, working-age people create a society's wealth.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
In retirement, you stop contributing as much to the economy.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
But the majority of healthcare costs are generated by seniors.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
The way the world worked in the past was that a lot of younger people took care of a few older people.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Imagine a society where most people are older than 60.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
The financial burden for the young will be immense, unsustainable, even for the richest countries.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Even in the best case, this will mean people having to work way longer,

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
exploding healthcare costs and poverty, while states with shrinking incomes struggle to keep up with rising costs.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Technology might soften the blow, but can't compensate entirely.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
We can see this happening already.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
11 out of 31 provinces in China are running deficits for their pension funds.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
They got old before they got rich, and now they can't really catch up anymore.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
China's working-age population is predicted to fall by 20%, or 200 million people by 2050,

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
as much as today's entire working-age population of the US.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Infrastructure collapse is an almost universal constant of population decline,

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
because infrastructure works at scale and doesn't get cheaper to operate if it's used by fewer people.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
If a population declines, be it because of urbanization or the loss of industry and employment,

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
once people and their income disappear, the resources necessary to sustain infrastructure disappear too.

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
You can see it in many depopulated towns and cities in East Germany that suffered sharp population decline after German reunification.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
Or look at Japan. You can tour the countryside to see dying towns.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Wait. If there are a few people, won't life get cheaper and better, and there'll be more resources to go around?

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, no. Population decline doesn't lead to prosperity.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
It's people's ideas and work that create our prosperity, not the mere availability of resources.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
Another danger for aging societies is that elected governments could decide to mostly represent the interests and fears of their elderly populations,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
potentially leading to short-term thinking and a preference for conserving wealth over innovation.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
That's not a society that can handle issues like climate change, which need massive investment and fresh ideas,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
something the world is already having a hard time with.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
Many people think that having fewer humans on Earth is actually a good thing because our societies are too unsustainable,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
we're using up too many resources, and because of climate change.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
The problem is that even if you want fewer humans, this process is very likely too slow to have a positive impact on the environment.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
The world population is going to grow for at least 60 more years before it may shrink again.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
By then, we have to solve climate change.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
Likewise, any other upsides a lower population might have will most likely not materialize themselves this century.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
So, just like import people, the easiest solution seems to be immigration,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
but the fertility of immigrants adjusts to local levels within three generations.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
So you need a constant influx of new migrants, which is not sustainable long-term, as birth rates are dropping everywhere.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
The only way would be to keep poor countries poor so that the young and motivated migrate to developed countries

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
looking for opportunity and a better life, kind of an immoral thing to wish for.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
By the end of the century, Africa will have the highest number of young people in the world,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
and so African migrants might become the world's most sought-after immigrants,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
elderly nations fighting hard for every person willing to make the move.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Immigration can also create societal or cultural tensions, which is a universal phenomenon in all cultures,

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
especially when cultures with very different sets of values meet, often leading to a backlash that slows immigration down again.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
It's easy to be frustrated at this, but ignoring this will only divide societies, empower demagogues, and increase xenophobia.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
Economically, immigration is largely beneficial for societies, even if this seems counterintuitive to many people.

08:31.000 --> 08:39.000
Especially countries like the US, an immigrant nation built on the idea of personal freedom and opportunity through hard work, will benefit the most.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
Countries like this will have a clear advantage this century, especially if they can attract the world's brightest and most ambitious.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Conclusion and our opinion.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
This topic is way too big, affects societies as diverse as literally all of humanity.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
So, please take this part with a gigantic grain of salt.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Obviously, we're looking at this from our central European perspective.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
One way to look at falling birth rates is as a side effect of the world being less bad than it was.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Especially women are freer, more educated, and wealthier than in the past.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
But it turns out that if societies are better off, individuals often decide to have fewer kids.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
Interestingly, there's a gap between how many kids people want and how many they're having.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
The mean number of kids women in Europe want is around 2.3, much more than they're actually having.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
While we gained a lot of freedoms in the last century, across continents and economic systems, that came at a cost.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
The tight-knit communities and family structures that were part of our nature, where kids could be brought up by a village.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Today, young parents have to deal with different challenges and societal expectations.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
Women are kind of ground down between the wish and expectation to have a family and a career.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Being pressured to do both, but not compromise either.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
Men are sharing parental duties more equally than they used to, but are often still expected to be the provider.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
And it's sadly true that usually at least one parent's career is held back.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
In many developed countries, the gender pay gap is chiefly a pay gap between mothers and everyone else.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
But it's not just outside pressure. Our culture of individualism probably plays a role too.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
We have only one life to explore, be free, travel, have fun, accomplish something, and try to be happy.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
So people commit to partners later in life and often decide against big families or any at all.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And that's fair. Nobody owes their country babies.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
So far, no country has successfully managed to increase birth rates significantly, so as of now, we don't really know what works.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
But here are a few options to at least make the lives of parents much easier.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
Free and abundant access to childcare, financial benefits for parents, more and cheaper housing.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Parenthood has to stop being a career obstacle, and our culture needs to become more positive towards families.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And that's something we can all work on.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
The next time you sit next to a crying baby, don't be a jerk about it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Kids are hard.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
In the end, humanity will not die out because we're having fewer babies.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
The age and composition of our societies changes quickly, and we need to deal with that sooner rather than later.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
But in the end, of all the incredibly hard challenges we've faced before, why would this be the one we can't solve?

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Getting to the bottom of the population crash starts with analyzing and interpreting massive amounts of data.
