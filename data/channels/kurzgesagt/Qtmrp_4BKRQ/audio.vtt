00:00.000 --> 00:07.980
It's time! Let's reveal the 12,024-human-era calendar with a big bang!

00:07.980 --> 00:12.500
The Kurzgesagt calendar is special because we're adding 10,000 years to include all

00:12.500 --> 00:18.420
of humanity no matter their culture or origin. 12,000 years ago, humans first started working

00:18.420 --> 00:23.020
together on a larger scale, laying the foundation for civilization and the future of us all

00:23.020 --> 00:27.620
– a much better representation of how far our species has come.

00:27.620 --> 00:31.540
This year, we're looking at the cosmos and all the possible life that could be thriving

00:31.540 --> 00:37.300
on myriads of worlds, hosting radically different animals and beings from the ones on Earth.

00:37.300 --> 00:42.120
Where in the universe might life exist? And how would different cosmic environments affect

00:42.120 --> 00:47.920
the basic rules of life? Join us in 12,024 and find out.
