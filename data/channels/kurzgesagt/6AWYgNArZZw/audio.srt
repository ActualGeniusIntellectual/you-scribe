00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
Let's shrink Earth to half its size. It now has a diameter of roughly six thousand four hundred kilometers and only one-eighth of its former

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,520
mass is left. Just like a rotating ice skater that pulls in their arms,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,400
the decreased size leads to faster rotation. One full day now lasts only 45 minutes. Also,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,040
gravity changes. On a half-sized Earth, all objects would be half as heavy. With lower gravity,

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,320
walking or running consumes less energy and we can cover longer distances on foot.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
However, we'd also be a bit slower.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,000
Furthermore, large parts of our atmosphere would fade away into space since gravity isn't strong enough to hold it.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,200
Less atmosphere means less oxygen and CO2, so you should bring an oxygen mask to your next outdoor activity

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,940
if you don't want to risk suffocating. Also, with the weaker pull of gravity, the bones and muscles of humans and animals would become thinner

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,280
and weaker, and the size and shape of trees would change significantly due to lower gravity in the thinner atmosphere.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,040
Overall, we'd live in a very different world.
