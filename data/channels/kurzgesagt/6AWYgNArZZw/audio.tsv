0	7980	Let's shrink Earth to half its size. It now has a diameter of roughly six thousand four hundred kilometers and only one-eighth of its former
7980	11520	mass is left. Just like a rotating ice skater that pulls in their arms,
11520	18400	the decreased size leads to faster rotation. One full day now lasts only 45 minutes. Also,
18720	24040	gravity changes. On a half-sized Earth, all objects would be half as heavy. With lower gravity,
24260	28320	walking or running consumes less energy and we can cover longer distances on foot.
28500	30500	However, we'd also be a bit slower.
30760	36000	Furthermore, large parts of our atmosphere would fade away into space since gravity isn't strong enough to hold it.
36360	42200	Less atmosphere means less oxygen and CO2, so you should bring an oxygen mask to your next outdoor activity
42200	48940	if you don't want to risk suffocating. Also, with the weaker pull of gravity, the bones and muscles of humans and animals would become thinner
48940	54280	and weaker, and the size and shape of trees would change significantly due to lower gravity in the thinner atmosphere.
54840	57040	Overall, we'd live in a very different world.
