0	6000	An ant is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan.
6000	10000	And yet, many ants together are smart.
10000	14000	An ant colony can construct complex structures.
14000	19000	Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle.
19000	22000	They can wage war or defend themselves.
22000	28000	How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together?
28000	36000	This phenomenon is called emergence, and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe.
36000	44000	In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things that have different properties than the sum of their parts.
44000	48000	Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity.
48000	52000	And emergence is everywhere.
59000	66000	Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up, like the concept of wetness.
66000	75000	Take wet fabric. If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness, there are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth.
75000	84000	Wetness is an emerging property of water, something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules.
85000	93000	And this is sort of it. Many things interact under a certain set of rules, creating something above and beyond themselves.
93000	96000	It turns out that more is different.
96000	103000	This different property is itself a new thing, and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process.
103000	109000	You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other, every layer made from more complex parts.
110000	122000	Atoms form molecules, molecules form proteins, proteins make up cells, cells make up organs, organs form individuals, individuals form societies.
122000	125000	But how can something be more than the sum of its parts?
125000	130000	How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony?
130000	134000	By following a rule set that produces order through chaos.
134000	138000	For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs.
138000	147000	Let's assume that a colony should have 25% workers, 25% caretakers, 25% soldiers, and 25% gatherers.
147000	150000	Ants communicate their current job via chemicals.
150000	155000	For example, a worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say, I'm a worker.
155000	162000	When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information, telling each other their job and what they're doing.
162000	165000	Both keep track of who they met in the past.
165000	169000	Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers.
169000	172000	If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve.
172000	178000	Many worker ants need to switch jobs, but how do you tell this to thousands of them?
178000	180000	Simple, you don't.
180000	187000	Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants, but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all.
187000	193000	It counts too few gatherers until it reaches a critical point and then it changes its job.
193000	195000	The worker becomes a gatherer.
195000	200000	Other ants will do the same until after a while there are enough gatherers again.
200000	203000	The balance is restored all by itself.
203000	207000	The actions and interactions of an individual are random.
207000	210000	You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant.
210000	217000	But the simple set of rules is so elegant that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence.
217000	225000	On an even more fundamental level, hundreds of millions of complicated molecules interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure.
225000	230000	A being with vastly different properties than the sum of its dead parts emerges.
230000	233000	The smallest unit of life, a cell.
233000	240000	We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are, we just know they emerge from things that are not alive.
240000	243000	Cells combine and cooperate.
243000	251000	They specialize and respond to one another and over time we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.
251000	260000	Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system made of trillions of individual stupid things.
260000	265000	And yet we breathe, digest and watch YouTube videos.
265000	268000	How do your cells know what to do?
268000	271000	Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart.
271000	277000	Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment to collectively create a heartbeat.
277000	284000	Our cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells to see what they're up to and then decide what to do.
284000	291000	If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task, it will start working on that task as well and sync up with them.
291000	300000	There is no mastermind giving commands, just single units communicating with their neighbors and acting according to the feedback they get.
300000	307000	What about our most important part? What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?
307000	312000	Is our consciousness then an emergent property of the cells in our brain?
312000	318000	This question is too big and important, it deserves a video of its own.
318000	321000	Some things that emerge are hard to define.
321000	325000	You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts.
325000	328000	It has neither brain nor face nor body.
328000	331000	And yet the colony interacts with the world.
331000	338000	Just like colonies emerge from ants, things emerge from humans, like nations.
338000	340000	What actually is a nation?
340000	341000	Is it its population?
341000	343000	Is it its institutions?
343000	347000	Its symbols like its flag, colors or anthems?
347000	350000	The physical things it makes like cities?
350000	352000	The territory it occupies?
352000	355000	All of these things are fluid.
355000	358000	Populations change and are replaced.
358000	363000	Institutions come and go, cities can be constructed and abandoned.
363000	366000	Borders have changed all the time for most of history.
366000	370000	And symbols get replaced by new symbols.
370000	375000	A nation has no face, no brain, no body.
375000	377000	Are nations not real then?
377000	378000	Of course they are.
378000	382000	Just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world.
382000	388000	They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline and they can stop existing.
388000	393000	But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other.
393000	395000	But not just nations.
395000	399000	All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us.
399000	403000	Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating.
403000	408000	Communities, companies, cities, societies.
408000	416000	All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from.
416000	418000	We don't know why any of this happens.
418000	423000	We just observe it and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe.
423000	428000	It may be the most beautiful and wondrous property of our universe.
