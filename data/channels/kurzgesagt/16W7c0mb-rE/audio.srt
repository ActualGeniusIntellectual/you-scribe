1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
An ant is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And yet, many ants together are smart.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
An ant colony can construct complex structures.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They can wage war or defend themselves.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This phenomenon is called emergence, and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things that have different properties than the sum of their parts.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And emergence is everywhere.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up, like the concept of wetness.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Take wet fabric. If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness, there are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wetness is an emerging property of water, something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And this is sort of it. Many things interact under a certain set of rules, creating something above and beyond themselves.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It turns out that more is different.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This different property is itself a new thing, and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other, every layer made from more complex parts.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Atoms form molecules, molecules form proteins, proteins make up cells, cells make up organs, organs form individuals, individuals form societies.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But how can something be more than the sum of its parts?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
By following a rule set that produces order through chaos.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's assume that a colony should have 25% workers, 25% caretakers, 25% soldiers, and 25% gatherers.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ants communicate their current job via chemicals.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
For example, a worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say, I'm a worker.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information, telling each other their job and what they're doing.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Both keep track of who they met in the past.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Many worker ants need to switch jobs, but how do you tell this to thousands of them?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Simple, you don't.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants, but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It counts too few gatherers until it reaches a critical point and then it changes its job.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The worker becomes a gatherer.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Other ants will do the same until after a while there are enough gatherers again.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The balance is restored all by itself.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The actions and interactions of an individual are random.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But the simple set of rules is so elegant that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
On an even more fundamental level, hundreds of millions of complicated molecules interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A being with vastly different properties than the sum of its dead parts emerges.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The smallest unit of life, a cell.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are, we just know they emerge from things that are not alive.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Cells combine and cooperate.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They specialize and respond to one another and over time we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system made of trillions of individual stupid things.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And yet we breathe, digest and watch YouTube videos.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How do your cells know what to do?

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment to collectively create a heartbeat.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Our cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells to see what they're up to and then decide what to do.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task, it will start working on that task as well and sync up with them.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There is no mastermind giving commands, just single units communicating with their neighbors and acting according to the feedback they get.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What about our most important part? What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is our consciousness then an emergent property of the cells in our brain?

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This question is too big and important, it deserves a video of its own.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Some things that emerge are hard to define.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It has neither brain nor face nor body.

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And yet the colony interacts with the world.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Just like colonies emerge from ants, things emerge from humans, like nations.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What actually is a nation?

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is it its population?

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Is it its institutions?

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Its symbols like its flag, colors or anthems?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The physical things it makes like cities?

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The territory it occupies?

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All of these things are fluid.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Populations change and are replaced.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Institutions come and go, cities can be constructed and abandoned.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Borders have changed all the time for most of history.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And symbols get replaced by new symbols.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A nation has no face, no brain, no body.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are nations not real then?

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course they are.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline and they can stop existing.

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But not just nations.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Communities, companies, cities, societies.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We don't know why any of this happens.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We just observe it and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe.

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It may be the most beautiful and wondrous property of our universe.
