0	6720	Getting to space is hard. Right now, it's like going up a mountain on a unicycle with
6720	12240	a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can't transport a lot of stuff,
12240	18560	and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 km an hour to escape
18560	24280	from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel, with a tiny
24280	29400	tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planet, because you need a lot
29400	35440	of heavy stuff if you want to survive and maybe even come back. So is there a way to
35440	48840	get to space with less fuel and more payload?
48840	54680	A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure.
54680	59600	Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains, we've made it easier
59600	66140	to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will
66140	73240	make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars, and beyond easier and cheaper. Great,
73240	78600	but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently
78600	84640	science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science
84640	89960	or magic materials or huge investments and that has been tested successfully in orbit
89960	98240	already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple, it's surprising.
98240	103640	What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long, into space and had spacecraft
103640	110480	use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the
110480	115820	Skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. The counterweight holds a long cable
115820	121160	in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative
121160	126040	to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means
126040	130460	that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more
130460	136320	or less for free, equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already
136320	141320	exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with. To
141320	146140	protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into
146140	151720	a web of redundant fibers. Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a
151720	157280	day, this would allow small reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it's not that
157280	161800	easy. At its lowest point, the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around
161800	166720	12,000 kilometers per hour. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can't lower the Skyhook too
166720	173280	much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers
173280	179320	and no lower. To match this, we'll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While
179320	184060	this isn't exactly easy, it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled
184060	189240	with rocket fuel to go 40,000 kilometers an hour. Catching the tip will be a challenge
189240	194640	too. There's only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the
194640	200680	sky moving at Mach 12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line
200680	206260	a kilometer long with a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge
206260	211240	is keeping our Skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves
211240	216180	up, they use up the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don't do anything, it will
216180	221900	slow down and crash into the atmosphere. And here we can cheat the universe a bit.
221900	228660	The Skyhook is a battery of orbital energy. It's possible to balance the payloads coming in and
228660	234860	being sent off. Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to Earth add energy to the tether,
234860	240660	which it can give to other ships departing into space. This way the tether doesn't lose any energy.
240660	246220	The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we're still losing energy with each boost,
246220	250980	we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct the tether's
250980	256180	position. A set of tethers, one around Earth and one around Mars, could make trips between the
256180	261860	planets fast, straightforward, and low-cost compared to rockets. The Earth tether would sit
261860	267260	in low Earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to Mars. The Mars tether catches
267260	272380	them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In the opposite direction, the tether
272380	277340	could pick up a vehicle traveling through Mars's thin atmosphere at only about 1,000 kilometers
277340	282460	an hour, not much faster than our airliners on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught
282460	288420	and lowered down. The tethers could shorten trips between both planets from nine months down to five
288420	295940	or even three and reduce the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96%. Even better,
296060	301420	people may be able to travel in relative luxury, as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort.
301420	307740	Tether travel would be first-class seats to Mars. Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could
307740	312900	provide the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable.
312900	319220	But let's go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt.
319220	324220	The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination.
324220	328900	Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free.
328900	335300	Getting to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system.
335300	340100	Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they
340100	345220	were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary
345220	352100	civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the solar
352140	357540	system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don't need to worry about
357540	363460	slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for super tethers just under 6,000 kilometers
363460	368420	long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very easy to catch.
368420	374940	The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same super tether can
374940	382060	also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single swingaway. Unlike Mars,
382060	387500	they're bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals. In the long term,
387500	392500	nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellant transport network for the
392500	398860	terrestrial planets centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably cheap and sustainable
398860	403900	solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar system accessible
403900	409420	for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to build them today,
409540	415700	there's really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system are far away,
415700	423500	but they could be very close. Speaking of stuff that's hard to reach but doesn't have to be,
