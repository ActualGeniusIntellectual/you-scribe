1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Getting to space is hard. Right now, it's like going up a mountain on a unicycle with

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,240
a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can't transport a lot of stuff,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,560
and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 km an hour to escape

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,280
from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel, with a tiny

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,400
tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planet, because you need a lot

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,440
of heavy stuff if you want to survive and maybe even come back. So is there a way to

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:48,840
get to space with less fuel and more payload?

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,680
A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure.

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,600
Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains, we've made it easier

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,140
to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,240
make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars, and beyond easier and cheaper. Great,

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,600
but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,640
science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,960
or magic materials or huge investments and that has been tested successfully in orbit

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:38,240
already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple, it's surprising.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,640
What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long, into space and had spacecraft

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,480
use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,820
Skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. The counterweight holds a long cable

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,160
in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,040
to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,460
that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more

22
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,320
or less for free, equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,320
exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with. To

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,140
protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into

25
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,720
a web of redundant fibers. Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,280
day, this would allow small reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it's not that

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,800
easy. At its lowest point, the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,720
12,000 kilometers per hour. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can't lower the Skyhook too

29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,280
much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,320
and no lower. To match this, we'll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,060
this isn't exactly easy, it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,240
with rocket fuel to go 40,000 kilometers an hour. Catching the tip will be a challenge

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,640
too. There's only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the

34
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,680
sky moving at Mach 12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line

35
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,260
a kilometer long with a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,240
is keeping our Skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,180
up, they use up the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don't do anything, it will

38
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,900
slow down and crash into the atmosphere. And here we can cheat the universe a bit.

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,660
The Skyhook is a battery of orbital energy. It's possible to balance the payloads coming in and

40
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,860
being sent off. Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to Earth add energy to the tether,

41
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,660
which it can give to other ships departing into space. This way the tether doesn't lose any energy.

42
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,220
The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we're still losing energy with each boost,

43
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,980
we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct the tether's

44
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,180
position. A set of tethers, one around Earth and one around Mars, could make trips between the

45
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,860
planets fast, straightforward, and low-cost compared to rockets. The Earth tether would sit

46
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,260
in low Earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to Mars. The Mars tether catches

47
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,380
them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In the opposite direction, the tether

48
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,340
could pick up a vehicle traveling through Mars's thin atmosphere at only about 1,000 kilometers

49
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,460
an hour, not much faster than our airliners on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught

50
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,420
and lowered down. The tethers could shorten trips between both planets from nine months down to five

51
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:55,940
or even three and reduce the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96%. Even better,

52
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,420
people may be able to travel in relative luxury, as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort.

53
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,740
Tether travel would be first-class seats to Mars. Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could

54
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,900
provide the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable.

55
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,220
But let's go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt.

56
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,220
The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination.

57
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,900
Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free.

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,300
Getting to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system.

59
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they

60
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,220
were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary

61
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:52,100
civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the solar

62
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,540
system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don't need to worry about

63
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,460
slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for super tethers just under 6,000 kilometers

64
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,420
long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very easy to catch.

65
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,940
The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same super tether can

66
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:22,060
also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single swingaway. Unlike Mars,

67
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,500
they're bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals. In the long term,

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,500
nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellant transport network for the

69
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,860
terrestrial planets centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably cheap and sustainable

70
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,900
solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar system accessible

71
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,420
for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to build them today,

72
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,700
there's really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system are far away,

73
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,500
but they could be very close. Speaking of stuff that's hard to reach but doesn't have to be,
