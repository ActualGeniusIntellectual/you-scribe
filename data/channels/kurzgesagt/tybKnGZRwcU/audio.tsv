0	7000	Be prepared to make contact. Our new limited drop has landed, only on the Kurzgesagt Shop.
12000	18000	Another day at the Kurzgesagt Labs, where we answer the most important questions with science.
18000	23000	Today, how might civilizations wage war across light years?
23000	28000	What kind of devastating weapons could they use, and what would they look like?
28000	33000	We meet our two players, a yellow dwarf star system, home to a species of primates.
33000	38000	Humans, as they call themselves, recently became a technological civilization.
38000	43000	They have rockets, nuclear reactors, and memes. How cute.
43000	53000	The Smorpians disagree. They reside on a planet around the orange dwarf star HD 40307, 42 light years away.
53000	58000	The Smorpian civilization developed earlier than humans, and they have much better technology.
58000	63000	They've recently built a Dyson swarm around their star, which gives them near limitless energy.
63000	70000	And they noticed humanity, which is unfortunate as the Smorpians are planning a hyperspace bypass through our solar system.
70000	73000	So they decided that humanity has to go.
73000	80000	Interstellar war is hard though. Frontlines, tactics, and logistics are meaningless at these scales.
80000	87000	It's also fought across time. Decades will pass between firing a weapon and learning whether it hit or not.
87000	90000	Sending an invasion fleet is futile.
90000	97000	Even if the Smorpians travel at a large fraction of the speed of light, the journey to Earth would take decades or even centuries.
97000	100000	And humans would have plenty of time to prepare.
100000	107000	If you want to learn more about the mind-numbing problem of war between alien civilizations, we made a video about it.
107000	114000	Today, we'll help the Smorpians construct a weapon that is not only extremely long-range and as fast as physically possible,
114000	116000	but that will totally destroy everything on Earth.
116000	121000	So, no human survivors will come to enact vengeance on Smorp in the future.
121000	125000	In interstellar war, you want to win with one shot.
125000	129000	Our bird scientists have found three Smorpian designs.
129000	135000	The Star Laser, the Relativistic Missile, and the Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam.
135000	140000	All based on real technologies that humans are using in some form already.
140000	142000	Let's see how they work.
142000	144000	The Star Laser.
144000	152000	As an advanced technological civilization, the Smorpians harness the energy of their star by surrounding it with billions of solar power satellites.
152000	156000	This Dyson Swarm collects 1% of the star's energy output.
156000	159000	A million, billion, billion watts.
159000	163000	50 billion times more than all humanity generates.
163000	169000	What if all the power of the Dyson Swarm, all those satellites, were used to create a Star Laser?
169000	173000	Like any laser, the bigger it is, the longer its range.
173000	178000	Human-built lasers use small mirrors to focus, so they have short ranges.
178000	185000	The Smorpians could turn their entire Dyson Swarm into a collective focusing element a million kilometers wide.
185000	188000	The Star Laser has an insane range as a result.
188000	193000	Enough to focus on target Earth from a distance of over 2 million light years.
193000	196000	Okay, let's shoot it.
196000	200000	Countless tiny beams combine into a single huge beam.
200000	210000	Laser beams are normally invisible in space, but the Star Laser is so powerful that light scattering off bits of dust and gas in its path makes it clearly visible in the sky.
210000	212000	A gigantic column of green light.
212000	217000	The laser travels at the speed of light, which oddly enough is still pretty slow on a galactic level.
217000	223000	It takes a whole day until the laser has left the Smorpian system, shooting into the emptiness between stars.
223000	229000	It will travel for decades, occasionally melting the odd bit of interstellar dust or asteroid.
229000	234000	42 years after being fired, it arrives without warning.
234000	239000	Humans only notice a weird green glow in the sky, and then they're gone.
239000	246000	1% of the energy of a star concentrated into a beam the diameter of Earth, traveling 42 light years.
246000	251000	It burns the exposed half of the planet with the intensity of 3 million suns.
251000	258000	The seas boil and evaporate, fires scour the land, and within minutes Earth's crust begins to melt into a sea of lava.
258000	263000	As the planet rotates, it turns into a red hot hell with no trace of life.
263000	266000	After a day it's all over and the laser dies down.
266000	270000	In another 42 years, the Smorpians will know if they've been successful.
270000	276000	That's another thing about interstellar war. When you attack, your grandchildren will be the ones to find out if you won.
276000	283000	It's like all the bombs from World War II exploding in the 80s, and us only seeing the effect today.
283000	292000	Okay, the star laser's extreme range, speed of light attack, and ability to melt down any target make it a premier interstellar weapon.
292000	294000	But is there something else?
295000	297000	The relativistic missile.
297000	305000	What if, instead of converting the energy of their Dyson swarm into a laser, the Smorpians used it to shoot a super bullet?
305000	309000	A relativistic missile, going as close to the speed of light as possible.
309000	318000	This sort of weapon is at the limits of what the Smorpians' technology can handle, as it requires loads of a highly dangerous material, antimatter.
318000	320000	The evil twin of regular matter.
320000	324000	Humans have only managed to produce a few nanograms of antimatter.
324000	331000	With their unlimited energy, Smorpians can manufacture it at an industrial scale to build antimatter rockets.
331000	339000	When antimatter and matter are mixed, they annihilate, which in more practical terms means there's a big, big boom releasing gamma rays and plasma.
339000	349000	The physics is complicated, but basically, if you have a really strong magnetic field, you can deflect the plasma through a nozzle, just like in the chemical rockets humans use.
349000	354000	But it would be much, much faster. The fastest rocket possibly, basically.
354000	358000	Our relativistic missile is much bigger than a skyscraper.
358000	363000	At the bottom is the bell-shaped magnetic nozzle, 100 meters wide.
363000	369000	On top of it are 250 floors filled with antimatter and matter, ready to annihilate each other.
369000	375000	On the top floor is a 300 kilogram projectile, looking quite small, about the size of a person.
375000	381000	To stop them getting damaged on the way, the missiles have dozens of sacrificial layers that form a whipple shield.
381000	386000	To make sure they do their job, the Smorpians build 1,000 missiles.
386000	388000	Let's fire them!
388000	391000	Launching all the relativistic missiles is a spectacular event.
391000	396000	For a moment, the antimatter engines lighting up outside their star.
396000	404000	Their exhaust is a long trail of brilliant white, and as they accelerate away, they appear redder and redder until they turn invisible.
404000	415000	With the extreme amount of energy released by the matter-antimatter reactions, the missiles are accelerated to 99.9999996% of the speed of light.
415000	420000	They have effectively infinite range, as there's nothing really to slow them down.
420000	423000	They arrive shortly after you can see them.
423000	426000	The light from their launch will take 42 years to reach Earth.
426000	432000	So, human astronomers might see the flash of the missiles' launch, and then a few days later, they'll hit.
432000	434000	Not enough time to prepare.
434000	441000	Each relativistic missile packs the kinetic energy of a dinosaur-killer asteroid, so only one needs to hit.
441000	446000	They never reach the ground, disintegrating instead at the edge of Earth's atmosphere.
446000	449000	Intense blue flashes set everything on fire.
449000	459000	Then, continent-sized fireballs slam down on the surface to smash everything into dust, repeatedly, until nothing is left but rubble and smoke.
459000	467000	So, interstellar missiles with unlimited range, minimal warning, and delivering complete destruction of a planet's surface.
467000	468000	Nice.
468000	471000	But they are a hassle to build.
471000	473000	Is there something else, maybe?
473000	476000	The ultra-relativistic electron beam.
476000	483000	Humans do funny things to their food to rid it of bacteria and make it safe to eat, like shooting electron beams at strawberries.
484000	490000	Small particle accelerators send electrons into the food with an energy similar to the radiation from nuclear reactions.
490000	494000	Not enough to burn the food, but deadly to bacteria.
494000	497000	Smorpions had the same idea, but bigger.
497000	500000	The main challenge with an electron beam is range.
500000	505000	Electrons are negatively charged particles, so they don't want to stay near each other.
505000	509000	A regular electron beam will quickly spread out, making it harmless.
509000	512000	Smorpions need it to cover distances of dozens of light-years.
512000	519000	So, they've used the rules of the universe to trick the electrons by building an ultra-relativistic electron beam, or UREB.
519000	536000	What it does is accelerate the electrons to 99.9999999999999999998% of the speed of light.
537000	540000	Faster than even the most powerful cosmic rays.
540000	546000	The closer something travels to the speed of light, the slower time moves for it, relative to the rest of the universe.
546000	555000	And since these electrons are moving so incredibly fast for every second of spreading they experience, over 5 million years pass in real time.
555000	562000	A physics trick that lets the beam cross interstellar distances while remaining tightly focused on its target.
562000	566000	The biggest particle accelerator on Earth is 27 kilometers long.
566000	570000	The Smorpions need one that's over 100,000 kilometers long.
570000	574000	A megastructure 8 times longer than Earth is wide.
574000	578000	It's mostly a tube of magnets holding the beam together until the exit.
578000	583000	Like a long trumpet of doom, surrounded by an aura of deadly radiation.
583000	588000	When it's fired, it produces a ruler-straight lightning bolt pointed at Earth.
588000	591000	Its effects on arrival are less visible than the other weapons.
591000	595000	No flashes of light, no massive firestorms, no explosions.
595000	599000	It doesn't destroy rocks, it destroys DNA.
599000	603000	People get dizzy, then fall sick as their cells are pierced by radiation.
603000	607000	You might think that a deep bunker could save a few humans, but no.
607000	614000	The Europe is so penetrating that its effects accumulate to lethal doses even underground over days or weeks.
614000	619000	In the end, just like our strawberries, Earth becomes sterile.
620000	622000	Simulation results.
622000	629000	Hm, another elaborate animated science explainer by Kotzgesagt where we've learned a lot, not sure exactly what.
629000	635000	Luckily, the Smorpions don't really exist, but others might.
635000	640000	One major downside of all our weapons is that others around the Milky Way could see you firing them,
640000	646000	which is not ideal because you don't want to present yourself as a dangerous species and tell everybody where exactly you are.
646000	655000	So maybe instead of shouting or shooting out into the universe, the best course of action seems to be to stay relatively quiet for now and observe.
655000	661000	Maybe one day we'll witness distant stars shooting at each other and be glad we stayed out of it.
662000	665000	But we don't have to stay out of intergalactic fun.
665000	670000	There's a peaceful way to join Type II civilizations on their galactic adventures.
