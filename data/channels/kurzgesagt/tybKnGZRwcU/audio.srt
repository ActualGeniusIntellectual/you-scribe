1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Be prepared to make contact. Our new limited drop has landed, only on the Kurzgesagt Shop.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Another day at the Kurzgesagt Labs, where we answer the most important questions with science.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today, how might civilizations wage war across light years?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What kind of devastating weapons could they use, and what would they look like?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We meet our two players, a yellow dwarf star system, home to a species of primates.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Humans, as they call themselves, recently became a technological civilization.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They have rockets, nuclear reactors, and memes. How cute.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The Smorpians disagree. They reside on a planet around the orange dwarf star HD 40307, 42 light years away.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Smorpian civilization developed earlier than humans, and they have much better technology.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They've recently built a Dyson swarm around their star, which gives them near limitless energy.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And they noticed humanity, which is unfortunate as the Smorpians are planning a hyperspace bypass through our solar system.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So they decided that humanity has to go.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Interstellar war is hard though. Frontlines, tactics, and logistics are meaningless at these scales.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's also fought across time. Decades will pass between firing a weapon and learning whether it hit or not.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sending an invasion fleet is futile.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Even if the Smorpians travel at a large fraction of the speed of light, the journey to Earth would take decades or even centuries.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And humans would have plenty of time to prepare.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you want to learn more about the mind-numbing problem of war between alien civilizations, we made a video about it.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Today, we'll help the Smorpians construct a weapon that is not only extremely long-range and as fast as physically possible,

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but that will totally destroy everything on Earth.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, no human survivors will come to enact vengeance on Smorp in the future.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In interstellar war, you want to win with one shot.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Our bird scientists have found three Smorpian designs.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Star Laser, the Relativistic Missile, and the Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All based on real technologies that humans are using in some form already.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's see how they work.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The Star Laser.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As an advanced technological civilization, the Smorpians harness the energy of their star by surrounding it with billions of solar power satellites.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This Dyson Swarm collects 1% of the star's energy output.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A million, billion, billion watts.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
50 billion times more than all humanity generates.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What if all the power of the Dyson Swarm, all those satellites, were used to create a Star Laser?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Like any laser, the bigger it is, the longer its range.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Human-built lasers use small mirrors to focus, so they have short ranges.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Smorpians could turn their entire Dyson Swarm into a collective focusing element a million kilometers wide.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The Star Laser has an insane range as a result.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Enough to focus on target Earth from a distance of over 2 million light years.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, let's shoot it.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Countless tiny beams combine into a single huge beam.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Laser beams are normally invisible in space, but the Star Laser is so powerful that light scattering off bits of dust and gas in its path makes it clearly visible in the sky.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A gigantic column of green light.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The laser travels at the speed of light, which oddly enough is still pretty slow on a galactic level.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It takes a whole day until the laser has left the Smorpian system, shooting into the emptiness between stars.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It will travel for decades, occasionally melting the odd bit of interstellar dust or asteroid.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
42 years after being fired, it arrives without warning.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Humans only notice a weird green glow in the sky, and then they're gone.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
1% of the energy of a star concentrated into a beam the diameter of Earth, traveling 42 light years.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It burns the exposed half of the planet with the intensity of 3 million suns.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The seas boil and evaporate, fires scour the land, and within minutes Earth's crust begins to melt into a sea of lava.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
As the planet rotates, it turns into a red hot hell with no trace of life.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
After a day it's all over and the laser dies down.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In another 42 years, the Smorpians will know if they've been successful.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's another thing about interstellar war. When you attack, your grandchildren will be the ones to find out if you won.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's like all the bombs from World War II exploding in the 80s, and us only seeing the effect today.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay, the star laser's extreme range, speed of light attack, and ability to melt down any target make it a premier interstellar weapon.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But is there something else?

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The relativistic missile.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What if, instead of converting the energy of their Dyson swarm into a laser, the Smorpians used it to shoot a super bullet?

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
A relativistic missile, going as close to the speed of light as possible.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This sort of weapon is at the limits of what the Smorpians' technology can handle, as it requires loads of a highly dangerous material, antimatter.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The evil twin of regular matter.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Humans have only managed to produce a few nanograms of antimatter.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
With their unlimited energy, Smorpians can manufacture it at an industrial scale to build antimatter rockets.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When antimatter and matter are mixed, they annihilate, which in more practical terms means there's a big, big boom releasing gamma rays and plasma.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The physics is complicated, but basically, if you have a really strong magnetic field, you can deflect the plasma through a nozzle, just like in the chemical rockets humans use.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But it would be much, much faster. The fastest rocket possibly, basically.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Our relativistic missile is much bigger than a skyscraper.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
At the bottom is the bell-shaped magnetic nozzle, 100 meters wide.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
On top of it are 250 floors filled with antimatter and matter, ready to annihilate each other.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
On the top floor is a 300 kilogram projectile, looking quite small, about the size of a person.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
To stop them getting damaged on the way, the missiles have dozens of sacrificial layers that form a whipple shield.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To make sure they do their job, the Smorpians build 1,000 missiles.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's fire them!

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Launching all the relativistic missiles is a spectacular event.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
For a moment, the antimatter engines lighting up outside their star.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Their exhaust is a long trail of brilliant white, and as they accelerate away, they appear redder and redder until they turn invisible.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
With the extreme amount of energy released by the matter-antimatter reactions, the missiles are accelerated to 99.9999996% of the speed of light.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They have effectively infinite range, as there's nothing really to slow them down.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They arrive shortly after you can see them.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The light from their launch will take 42 years to reach Earth.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So, human astronomers might see the flash of the missiles' launch, and then a few days later, they'll hit.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Not enough time to prepare.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Each relativistic missile packs the kinetic energy of a dinosaur-killer asteroid, so only one needs to hit.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They never reach the ground, disintegrating instead at the edge of Earth's atmosphere.

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Intense blue flashes set everything on fire.

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then, continent-sized fireballs slam down on the surface to smash everything into dust, repeatedly, until nothing is left but rubble and smoke.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, interstellar missiles with unlimited range, minimal warning, and delivering complete destruction of a planet's surface.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Nice.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But they are a hassle to build.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is there something else, maybe?

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The ultra-relativistic electron beam.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Humans do funny things to their food to rid it of bacteria and make it safe to eat, like shooting electron beams at strawberries.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Small particle accelerators send electrons into the food with an energy similar to the radiation from nuclear reactions.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Not enough to burn the food, but deadly to bacteria.

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Smorpions had the same idea, but bigger.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The main challenge with an electron beam is range.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Electrons are negatively charged particles, so they don't want to stay near each other.

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A regular electron beam will quickly spread out, making it harmless.

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Smorpions need it to cover distances of dozens of light-years.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, they've used the rules of the universe to trick the electrons by building an ultra-relativistic electron beam, or UREB.

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What it does is accelerate the electrons to 99.9999999999999999998% of the speed of light.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Faster than even the most powerful cosmic rays.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The closer something travels to the speed of light, the slower time moves for it, relative to the rest of the universe.

104
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And since these electrons are moving so incredibly fast for every second of spreading they experience, over 5 million years pass in real time.

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
A physics trick that lets the beam cross interstellar distances while remaining tightly focused on its target.

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The biggest particle accelerator on Earth is 27 kilometers long.

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The Smorpions need one that's over 100,000 kilometers long.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
A megastructure 8 times longer than Earth is wide.

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's mostly a tube of magnets holding the beam together until the exit.

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like a long trumpet of doom, surrounded by an aura of deadly radiation.

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When it's fired, it produces a ruler-straight lightning bolt pointed at Earth.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Its effects on arrival are less visible than the other weapons.

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No flashes of light, no massive firestorms, no explosions.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It doesn't destroy rocks, it destroys DNA.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
People get dizzy, then fall sick as their cells are pierced by radiation.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You might think that a deep bunker could save a few humans, but no.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The Europe is so penetrating that its effects accumulate to lethal doses even underground over days or weeks.

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
In the end, just like our strawberries, Earth becomes sterile.

119
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Simulation results.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hm, another elaborate animated science explainer by Kotzgesagt where we've learned a lot, not sure exactly what.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Luckily, the Smorpions don't really exist, but others might.

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
One major downside of all our weapons is that others around the Milky Way could see you firing them,

123
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
which is not ideal because you don't want to present yourself as a dangerous species and tell everybody where exactly you are.

124
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So maybe instead of shouting or shooting out into the universe, the best course of action seems to be to stay relatively quiet for now and observe.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Maybe one day we'll witness distant stars shooting at each other and be glad we stayed out of it.

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But we don't have to stay out of intergalactic fun.

127
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
There's a peaceful way to join Type II civilizations on their galactic adventures.

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Look, it's the Galactic Club, a cozy corner in the vast universe reserved for friendly, quirky folk like you.
